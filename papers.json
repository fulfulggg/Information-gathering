    "summary": "arXiv:2506.19977v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Understanding which parts of the retrieved context contribute to a large language model's generated answer is essential for building interpretable and trustworthy generative QA systems. We propose a novel framework that formulates context attribution as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problem. Each context segment is treated as a bandit arm, and we employ Combinatorial Thompson Sampling (CTS) to efficiently explore the exponentially large space of context subsets under a limited query budget. Our method defines a reward function based on normalized token likelihoods, capturing how well a subset of segments supports the original model response. Unlike traditional perturbation-based attribution methods such as SHAP, which sample subsets uniformly and incur high computational costs, our approach adaptively balances exploration and exploitation by leveraging posterior estimates of segment relevance. This leads to substantially improved query efficiency while maintaining high attribution fidelity. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets and LLMs demonstrate that our method achieves competitive attribution quality with fewer model queries.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20009v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical implications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and DeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems for medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and safety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2 emissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various open-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like llama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs performance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs o4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation. Results Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy consumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy (58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and DeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption and CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a total CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x times more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while maintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs can be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in medical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular framework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and aligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.",

This motivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when debating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety, and can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported that large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive biases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward identity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate whether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic attributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and proprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity discernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific evidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity discernment relative to models without personas. Political personas specifically, are up to 90% more likely to correctly evaluate scientific evidence on gun control when the ground truth is congruent with their induced political identity. Prompt-based debiasing methods are largely ineffective at mitigating these effects. Taken together, our empirical findings are the first to suggest that persona-assigned LLMs exhibit human-like motivated reasoning that is hard to mitigate through conventional debiasing prompts -- raising concerns of exacerbating identity-congruent reasoning in both LLMs and humans.",

We propose DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to its corresponding description and classifies test results as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space, we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction.",

Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation), generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach; new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\\sim$350M parameters) with a narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\\sim$86\\% percentage point improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common benchmarks).

However, existing research centers on offline reinforcement learning training or online optimization using action-level rewards, which limits the agent's dynamic interaction with the environment. This often results in agents settling into local optima, thereby weakening their ability for exploration and error action correction. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach called Mobile-R1, which employs interactive multi-turn reinforcement learning with task-level rewards for mobile agents. Our training framework consists of three stages: initial format finetuning, single-step online training via action-level reward, followed by online training via task-level reward based on multi-turn trajectories. This strategy is designed to enhance the exploration and error correction capabilities of Mobile-R1, leading to significant performance improvements. Moreover, we have collected a dataset covering 28 Chinese applications with 24,521 high-quality manual annotations and established a new benchmark with 500 trajectories.

Unlike conventional vehicles, EVs often have a shorter driving range, necessitating careful consideration of charging when fulfilling requests. With recent advances in Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology - allowing EVs to also discharge energy back to the grid - new opportunities and complexities emerge. We introduce the Electric Vehicle Orienteering Problem with V2G (EVOP-V2G): a profit-maximization problem where EV drivers must select customer requests or orders while managing when and where to charge or discharge. This involves navigating dynamic electricity prices, charging station selection, and route constraints. We formulate the problem as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and propose two near-optimal metaheuristic algorithms: one evolutionary (EA) and the other based on large neighborhood search (LNS). Experiments on real-world data show our methods can double driver profits compared to baselines, while maintaining near-optimal performance on small instances and excellent scalability on larger ones. Our work highlights a promising path toward smarter, more profitable EV-based mobility systems that actively support the energy grid.",

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful general-purpose reasoning capabilities, offer a promising foundation for such decision-making. However, their direct application to autonomous driving remains limited due to challenges in domain adaptation, contextual grounding, and the lack of experiential knowledge needed to make reliable and interpretable decisions in dynamic, high-risk environments. To address this gap, this paper presents a Case-Based Reasoning Augmented Large Language Model (CBR-LLM) framework for evasive maneuver decision-making in complex risk scenarios. Our approach integrates semantic scene understanding from dashcam video inputs with the retrieval of relevant past driving cases, enabling LLMs to generate maneuver recommendations that are both context-sensitive and human-aligned. Experiments across multiple open-source LLMs show that our framework improves decision accuracy, justification quality, and alignment with human expert behavior. Risk-aware prompting strategies further enhance performance across diverse risk types, while similarity-based case retrieval consistently outperforms random sampling in guiding in-context learning. Case studies further demonstrate the framework's robustness in challenging real-world conditions, underscoring its potential as an adaptive and trustworthy decision-support tool for intelligent driving systems.",

Two parallel methodologies, fine-tuning and prompt engineering, were explored for agent optimisation. Both methods demonstrated effectiveness at improving the performance of the information extraction agent in terms of transformer-based cosine similarity scores between obtained and ideal outputs. Mean cosine similarity scores were increased by up to 25%, while universally reaching mean scores of $\\geq 0.89$ against ideal output text. Fine-tuning overall improved the mean scores to a greater extent (consistently of $\\geq 0.94$) compared to prompt engineering, although lower statistical uncertainties were observed with the latter approach.

This paper presents initial experiences designing and evaluating these tools, focusing on system architecture, using RAG and reranking for PETSc-specific information, evaluation methodologies for various LLMs and embedding models, and user interface design. Leveraging the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility resources, we analyze how LLM responses can enhance the development and use of numerical software, with an initial focus on scalable Krylov solvers.

However, existing agents typically operate in isolation on a given research problem, without engaging with the broader research community, where human researchers often gain insights and contribute by sharing knowledge. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLE-Live, a live evaluation framework designed to assess an agent's ability to communicate with and leverage collective knowledge from a simulated Kaggle research community. Building on this framework, we propose CoMind, a novel agent that excels at exchanging insights and developing novel solutions within a community context. CoMind achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLE-Live and outperforms 79.2% human competitors on average across four ongoing Kaggle competitions.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20664v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason about the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing interactive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and paves the path towards better artificial agents.",

These systems require models that can simultaneously capture fine-grained atomic interactions, long-range dependencies across spatially distant components, and biologically relevant hierarchical structure, such as atoms forming residues, which in turn form higher-order domains. Existing geometric GNNs, which typically operate exclusively in either Euclidean or Spherical Harmonics space, are limited in their ability to capture both the fine-scale atomic details and the long-range, symmetry-aware dependencies required for modeling the multi-scale structure of large biomolecules. We introduce DualEquiNet, a Dual-Space Hierarchical Equivariant Network that constructs complementary representations in both Euclidean and Spherical Harmonics spaces to capture local geometry and global symmetry-aware features. DualEquiNet employs bidirectional cross-space message passing and a novel Cross-Space Interaction Pooling mechanism to hierarchically aggregate atomic features into biologically meaningful units, such as residues, enabling efficient and expressive multi-scale modeling for large biomolecular systems.

Applications ranged from developing foundation models for fusion reactor control to automating Monte Carlo simulations, predicting material degradation, and designing experimental programs for advanced reactors. Teams employed structured workflows combining prompt engineering, deep research capabilities, and iterative refinement to generate hypotheses, prototype code, and research strategies. Key findings demonstrate that LLMs excel at early-stage exploration, literature synthesis, and workflow design, successfully identifying research gaps and generating plausible experimental frameworks. However, significant limitations emerged, including difficulties with novel materials designs, advanced code generation for modeling and simulation, and domain-specific details requiring expert validation. The successful outcomes resulted from expert-driven prompt engineering and treating AI as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for physics-based methods. The workshop validated AI's potential to accelerate nuclear energy research through rapid iteration and cross-disciplinary synthesis while highlighting the need for curated nuclear-specific datasets, workflow automation, and specialized model development.

Each record contains detailed fields of transaction identifier, timestamp, energy volume (kWh), transaction type (buy/sell), unit price, prosumer/consumer identifier (hashed for privacy), smart meter readings, geolocation regions, and settlement confirmation status. The dataset also includes system-calculated behavior metrics of transaction rate, variability of energy production, and historical pricing patterns. The system architecture proposed involves the integration of two layers, namely a blockchain layer and artificial intelligence (AI) layer, each playing a unique but complementary function in energy transaction securing and market intelligence improvement.

It is crucial for ensuring the security and efficiency of insurance systems. Although AI and machine learning algorithms have demonstrated strong performance in detecting fraudulent claims, the absence of standardized defense mechanisms renders current systems vulnerable to emerging adversarial threats. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based approach to conduct adversarial attacks on fraud detection systems. Our results indicate that an attacker, without knowledge of the training data or internal model details, can generate fraudulent cases that are classified as legitimate with a 99\\% attack success rate (ASR). By subtly modifying real insurance records and claims, adversaries can significantly increase the fraud risk, potentially bypassing compromised detection systems. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance the robustness of insurance fraud detection models against adversarial manipulation, thereby ensuring the stability and reliability of different insurance systems.",

This raises limits in scenarios with intermittent and moving speakers, i.e., speakers that may change position when they are inactive, thus leading to discontinuous spatial trajectories. This paper proposes to investigate the use of speaker embeddings, in a simple solution to this issue. We propose to perform identity reassignment post-tracking, using speaker embeddings. We leverage trajectory-related information provided by an initial tracking step and multichannel audio signal. Beamforming is used to enhance the signal towards the speakers' positions in order to compute speaker embeddings. These are then used to assign new track identities based on an enrollment pool. We evaluate the performance of the proposed speaker embedding-based identity reassignment method on a dataset where speakers change position during inactivity periods. Results show that it consistently improves the identity assignment performance of neural and standard tracking systems. In particular, we study the impact of beamforming and input duration for embedding extraction.",

Adaptive radiotherapy requires frequent modifications to treatment plans to account for anatomical variations, necessitating time-efficient solutions. Deep learning offers a promising solution to automate this process. To this end, we propose a two-stage, physics-guided deep learning pipeline for radiotherapy planning. In the first stage, our network is trained with direct supervision on treatment plan parameters, consisting of MLC and MU values. In the second stage, we incorporate an additional supervision signal derived from the predicted 3D dose distribution, integrating physics-based guidance into the training process. We train and evaluate our approach on 133 prostate cancer patients treated with a uniform 2-arc VMAT protocol delivering a dose of 62 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach, implemented using both 3D U-Net and UNETR architectures, consistently produces treatment plans that closely match clinical ground truths. Our method achieves a mean difference of D95% = 0.42 +/- 1.83 Gy and V95% = -0.22 +/- 1.87% at the PTV while generating dose distributions that reduce radiation exposure to organs at risk.

Particularly, due to the remarkable inference ability of LLMs, the privacy violation attack (PVA), revealed by Staab et al., introduces serious personal privacy issues. Existing defense methods mainly leverage LLMs to anonymize the input query, which requires costly inference time and cannot gain satisfactory defense performance. Moreover, directly rejecting the PVA query seems like an effective defense method, while the defense method is exposed, promoting the evolution of PVA. In this paper, we propose a novel defense paradigm based on retrieval-confused generation (RCG) of LLMs, which can efficiently and covertly defend the PVA. We first design a paraphrasing prompt to induce the LLM to rewrite the \"user comments\" of the attack query to construct a disturbed database. Then, we propose the most irrelevant retrieval strategy to retrieve the desired user data from the disturbed database. Finally, the \"data comments\" are replaced with the retrieved user data to form a defended query, leading to responding to the adversary with some wrong personal attributes, i.e., the attack fails. Extensive experiments are conducted on two datasets and eight popular LLMs to comprehensively evaluate the feasibility and the superiority of the proposed defense method.",

While adaptive keyframe extraction mitigates transmission overhead, existing approaches often overlook the causal relationships among allocated bandwidth, CPU frequency, and user perception, limiting QoE gains. This paper proposes an intelligent framework to maximize QoE by integrating adaptive keyframe extraction with causal-aware reinforcement learning (RL). First, a novel QoE metric is formulated using the Weber-Fechner Law, combining perceptual sensitivity, attention-driven priorities, and motion reconstruction accuracy. The QoE optimization problem is then modeled as a mixed integer programming (MIP) task, jointly optimizing keyframe ratios, bandwidth, and computational resources under horizon-fairness constraints. We propose Partial State Causal Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (PS-CDDPG), which integrates the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) method with causal influence detection. By leveraging causal information regarding how QoE is influenced and determined by various actions, we explore actions guided by weights calculated from causal inference (CI), which in turn improves training efficiency. Experiments conducted with the CMU Motion Capture Database demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces interactive latency, enhances QoE, and maintains fairness, achieving superior performance compared to benchmark methods.",

To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes RepuNet, a decentralized reputation system that categorizes threats in DFL and dynamically evaluates node behavior using metrics like model similarity, parameter changes, message latency, and communication volume. Nodes' influence in model aggregation is adjusted based on their reputation scores. RepuNet was integrated into the Nebula DFL platform and experimentally evaluated with MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets under non-IID distributions, using federations of up to 25 nodes in both fully connected and random topologies. Different attack intensities, frequencies, and activation intervals were tested. Results demonstrated that RepuNet effectively detects and mitigates malicious behavior, achieving F1 scores above 95% for MNIST scenarios and approximately 76% for CIFAR-10 cases. These outcomes highlight RepuNet's adaptability, robustness, and practical potential for mitigating threats in decentralized federated learning environments.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.19893v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Due to the surging amount of AI-generated content (AIGC), its provisioning to edges and mobile users from the cloud incurs substantial traffic on networks. Generative semantic communication (GSC) offers a promising solution by transmitting highly compact information, i.e., prompt text and latent representations, instead of high-dimensional AIGC data. However, GSC relies on the alignment between the knowledge in the cloud generative AI (GAI) and that possessed by the edges and users, and between the knowledge for wireless transmission and that of actual channels, which remains challenging. In this paper, we propose DeKA-g, a distillation-enabled knowledge alignment algorithm for GSC systems. The core idea is to distill the generation knowledge from the cloud-GAI into low-rank matrices, which can be incorporated by the edge and used to adapt the transmission knowledge to diverse wireless channel conditions. DeKA-g comprises two novel methods: metaword-aided knowledge distillation (MAKD) and variable-rate grouped SNR adaptation (VGSA). For MAKD, an optimized metaword is employed to enhance the efficiency of knowledge distillation, while VGSA enables efficient adaptation to diverse compression rates and SNR ranges. From simulation results, DeKA-g improves the alignment between the edge-generated images and the cloud-generated ones by 44%. Moreover, it adapts to compression rates with 116% higher efficiency than the baseline and enhances the performance in low-SNR conditions by 28%.",

One strategy to detect and mitigate these errors is the measurement of the uncertainty over neural network decisions. In this paper, we present a novel post-hoc framework for measuring the uncertainty of a decision based on retrieved training cases that have a similar activation vector to the query for each layer. Based on these retrieved cases, we propose two new metrics: Decision Change and Layer Uncertainty, which capture changes in nearest-neighbor class distributions across layers.

However, existing work does not address many of the unique challenges presented by code written for government applications. In particular, government enterprise software is often written in legacy languages like MUMPS or assembly language code (ALC) and the overall token lengths of these systems exceed the context window size for current commercially available LLMs. Additionally, LLMs are primarily trained on modern software languages and have undergone limited testing with legacy languages, making their ability to understand legacy languages unknown and, hence, an area for empirical study. This paper examines the application of LLMs in the modernization of legacy government code written in ALC and MUMPS, addressing the challenges of input limitations. We investigate various code-chunking methods to optimize the generation of summary module comments for legacy code files, evaluating the impact of code-chunking methods on the quality of documentation produced by different LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Mixtral, and Llama 3. Our results indicate that LLMs can select partition points closely aligned with human expert partitioning. We also find that chunking approaches have significant impact on downstream tasks such as documentation generation. LLM-created partitions produce comments that are up to 20% more factual and up to 10% more useful than when humans create partitions. Therefore, we conclude that LLMs can be used as suitable replacements for human partitioning of large codebases during LLM-aided modernization.",

However, parallel corpora are often scarce or non-existent for low-resource languages. In this paper, we propose CycleDistill, a bootstrapping approach leveraging LLMs and few-shot translation to obtain high-quality MT systems.

CycleDistill does not need parallel corpora beyond 1 to 4 few-shot examples, and in our experiments focusing on three Indian languages, by relying solely on monolingual corpora, it can achieve high-quality machine translation, improving upon a few-shot baseline model by over 20-30 chrF points on average in the first iteration.

Multireferential methods in particular suffer from large computational cost, which under the normal paradigm has to be paid anew for each system at a full price, ignoring commonalities in electronic structure across molecules. Quantum Monte Carlo with deep neural networks (deep QMC) uniquely offers to exploit such commonalities by pretraining transferable wavefunction models, but all such attempts were so far limited in scope. Here, we bring this new paradigm to fruition with Orbformer, a novel transferable wavefunction model pretrained on 22,000 equilibrium and dissociating structures that can be fine-tuned on unseen molecules reaching an accuracy-cost ratio rivalling classical multireferential methods. On established benchmarks as well as more challenging bond dissociations and Diels-Alder reactions, Orbformer is the only method that consistently converges to chemical accuracy (1 kcal/mol).

Using a dataset with 77 variables, including patient demographics and tumor characteristics, we developed QNN-based propensity score models focusing on four key covariates (Age, Sex, Stage, BMI). The QNN architecture employed a linear ZFeatureMap for data encoding, a SummedPaulis operator for predictions, and the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) for robust, gradient-free optimization in noisy quantum environments. Variance regularization was integrated to mitigate quantum measurement noise, with simulations conducted under exact, sampling (1024 shots), and noisy hardware (FakeManhattanV2) conditions. QNNs, particularly with simulated hardware noise, outperformed classical logistic regression and gradient boosted machines in small samples (AUC up to 0.750 for n=100), with noise modeling enhancing predictive stability. Propensity score matching and weighting, optimized via genetic matching and matching weights, achieved covariate balance with standardized mean differences of 0.0849 and 0.0869, respectively. Survival analyses using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Cox proportional hazards, and Aalen additive regression revealed no significant survival differences post-adjustment (p-values 0.287-0.851), indicating confounding bias in unadjusted outcomes.

However, learning-based methods often face challenges with limited training data, large deformations, and tend to underperform compared to iterative approaches when label supervision is unavailable. While iterative methods can achieve higher accuracy in such scenarios, they are considerably slower than learning-based methods. To address these limitations, we propose VoxelOpt, a discrete optimization-based DIR framework that combines the strengths of learning-based and iterative methods to achieve a better balance between registration accuracy and runtime. VoxelOpt uses displacement entropy from local cost volumes to measure displacement signal strength at each voxel, which differs from earlier approaches in three key aspects. First, it introduces voxel-wise adaptive message passing, where voxels with lower entropy receives less influence from their neighbors. Second, it employs a multi-level image pyramid with 27-neighbor cost volumes at each level, avoiding exponential complexity growth. Third, it replaces hand-crafted features or contrastive learning with a pretrained foundational segmentation model for feature extraction. In abdominal CT registration, these changes allow VoxelOpt to outperform leading iterative in both efficiency and accuracy, while matching state-of-the-art learning-based methods trained with label supervision.

One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called co-learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED yields curricula that improve zero-shot generalization across multiple benchmarks while requiring up to 2x fewer environment interactions than strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that the transition prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that co-learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition prediction error.

This common approach struggles to model complex temporal dependencies and fails to explicitly account for the progressive growth of uncertainty inherent to such systems. While rolling diffusion frameworks, which apply increasing noise to forecasts at longer lead times, have been proposed to address this, their integration with state-of-the-art, high-fidelity diffusion techniques remains a significant challenge. We tackle this problem by introducing Elucidated Rolling Diffusion Models (ERDM), the first framework to successfully unify a rolling forecast structure with the principled, performant design of Elucidated Diffusion Models (EDM). To do this, we adapt the core EDM components-its noise schedule, network preconditioning, and Heun sampler-to the rolling forecast setting. The success of this integration is driven by three key contributions: (i) a novel loss weighting scheme that focuses model capacity on the mid-range forecast horizons where determinism gives way to stochasticity; (ii) an efficient initialization strategy using a pre-trained EDM for the initial window; and (iii) a bespoke hybrid sequence architecture for robust spatiotemporal feature extraction under progressive denoising. On 2D Navier-Stokes simulations and ERA5 global weather forecasting at 1.5^\\circ resolution, ERDM consistently outperforms key diffusion-based baselines, including conditional autoregressive EDM. ERDM offers a flexible and powerful general framework for tackling diffusion-based sequence generation problems where modeling escalating uncertainty is paramount.

Moreover, traverse-affecting changes in the environment (rain, snow, blockades, etc.) may impact the expected performance of a COA, making it desirable to have a pool of COAs that are diverse in task distributions across agents. Further, variations in agent capabilities, which could be human crews and/or autonomous systems, present practical opportunities and computational challenges to the planning process. This paper presents a new theoretical formulation and computational framework to generate such diverse pools of COAs for operations with soft variations in agent-task compatibility. Key to the problem formulation is a graph abstraction of the task space and the pool of COAs itself to quantify its diversity. Formulating the COAs as a centralized multi-robot task allocation problem, a genetic algorithm is used for (order-ignoring) allocations of tasks to each agent that jointly maximize diversity within the COA pool and overall compatibility of the agent-task mappings. A graph neural network is trained using a policy gradient approach to then perform single agent task sequencing in each COA, which maximizes completion rates adaptive to task features. Our tests of the COA generation process in a simulated environment demonstrate significant performance gain over a random walk baseline, small optimality gap in task sequencing, and execution time of about 50 minutes to plan up to 20 COAs for 5 agent/100 task operations.",

We apply self-distillation, where the same network serves as both the teacher and student models, thereby avoiding the need to train several networks independently. To ensure the impact of self-distillation, we develop an uncertainty metric that captures the diverse nature of the network by assigning different weights to each GNN classifier. We experimentally evaluate the precision, performance, and ability of our approach in distinguishing out-of-distribution data on two graph datasets: MIMIC-IV and Enzymes. The evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively capture the predictive uncertainty of the model while having performance similar to that of the MC Dropout and ensemble methods.

We introduce SceneSense, a diffusion model designed and trained for predicting 3D occupancy maps given partial observations. Our proposed approach probabilistically fuses these predictions into a running occupancy map in real-time, resulting in significant improvements in map quality and traversability. We implement SceneSense onboard a quadruped robot and validate its performance with real-world experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. In these experiments, we show that occupancy maps enhanced with SceneSense predictions better represent our fully observed ground truth data (24.44% FID improvement around the robot and 75.59% improvement at range). We additionally show that integrating SceneSense-enhanced maps into our robotic exploration stack as a \"drop-in\" map improvement, utilizing an existing off-the-shelf planner, results in improvements in robustness and traversability time. Finally we show results of full exploration evaluations with our proposed system in two dissimilar environments and find that locally enhanced maps provide more consistent exploration results than maps constructed only from direct sensor measurements.",

To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable event.

However, existing models are often restricted to narrow tasks, lacking the capacity for multi-task inference and complex long-form reasoning that require generation of in-depth, explanatory outputs. These limitations restrict their applicability to real-world, multi-faceted decision scenarios. In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that integrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the analytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and execution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages in-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular, interpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both solutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we construct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework with metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning. Experimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM baselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex, reasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios. Human evaluations further validate STReason's credibility and practical utility, demonstrating its potential to reduce expert workload and broaden the applicability to real-world spatio-temporal tasks. We believe STReason provides a promising direction for developing more capable and generalizable spatio-temporal reasoning systems.",

Accurate detection and spatial localization of these artifacts are crucial for both automated quality control and for guiding the development of improved generative models.

Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or frame level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary for evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce BrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with meticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual corruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to ensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of the art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs) on BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted regions.

Existing evaluation methods often rely on simple lexical overlap metrics, which are inadequate for capturing these nuances, or involve complex multi-stage pipelines with intermediate steps like claim extraction or require finetuning specialized judge models, hindering practical efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose CCRS (Contextual Coherence and Relevance Score), a novel suite of five metrics that utilizes a single, powerful, pretrained LLM as a zero-shot, end-to-end judge. CCRS evaluates: Contextual Coherence (CC), Question Relevance (QR), Information Density (ID), Answer Correctness (AC), and Information Recall (IR). We apply CCRS to evaluate six diverse RAG system configurations on the challenging BioASQ dataset. Our analysis demonstrates that CCRS effectively discriminates between system performances, confirming, for instance, that the Mistral-7B reader outperforms Llama variants. We provide a detailed analysis of CCRS metric properties, including score distributions, convergent/discriminant validity, tie rates, population statistics, and discriminative power. Compared to the complex RAGChecker framework, CCRS offers comparable or superior discriminative power for key aspects like recall and faithfulness, while being significantly more computationally efficient.

However, removing undesired concepts from AR models while maintaining overall generation quality remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose Erasure Autoregressive Model (EAR), a fine-tuning method for effective and utility-preserving concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we introduce Windowed Gradient Accumulation (WGA) strategy to align patch-level decoding with erasure objectives, and Thresholded Loss Masking (TLM) strategy to protect content unrelated to the target concept during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose a novel benchmark, Erase Concept Generator and Visual Filter (ECGVF), aim at provide a more rigorous and comprehensive foundation for evaluating concept erasure in AR models. Specifically, we first employ structured templates across diverse large language models (LLMs) to pre-generate a large-scale corpus of target-replacement concept prompt pairs. Subsequently, we generate images from these prompts and subject them to rigorous filtering via a visual classifier to ensure concept fidelity and alignment. Extensive experimental results conducted on the ECGVF benchmark with the AR model Janus-Pro demonstrate that EAR achieves marked improvements in both erasure effectiveness and model utility preservation.

This paper presents an efficient Loss-Aware Automatic Selection of Structured Pruning Criteria (LAASP) for slimming and accelerating deep neural networks. The majority of pruning methodologies employ a sequential process consisting of three stages: 1) training, 2) pruning, and 3) fine-tuning, whereas the proposed pruning technique adopts a pruning-while-training approach that eliminates the first stage and integrates the second and third stages into a single cycle. The automatic selection of magnitude or similarity-based filter pruning criteria from a specified pool of criteria and the specific pruning layer at each pruning iteration is guided by the network's overall loss on a small subset of the training data. To mitigate the abrupt accuracy drop due to pruning, the network is retrained briefly after each reduction of a predefined number of floating-point operations (FLOPs). The optimal pruning rates for each layer in the network are automatically determined, eliminating the need for manual allocation of fixed or variable pruning rates for each layer. Experiments on the VGGNet and ResNet models on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, the ResNet56 and ResNet110 models on the CIFAR-10 dataset significantly improve the top-1 accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while reducing the network FLOPs by 52\\%. Furthermore, the ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset reduces FLOPs by more than 42\\% with a negligible 0.33\\% drop in top-5 accuracy.

Existing digital tools, however, inadequately support metacognitive reflection. Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) use de-contextualized review, overlooking the role of context, while Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) tools require high manual maintenance.\n  To address these challenges, this paper introduces \"Insight Recall,\" a novel paradigm that conceptualizes the context-triggered retrieval of personal past insights as a metacognitive scaffold to promote SRL. We formalize this paradigm using the Just-in-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) framework and implement a prototype system, Irec, to demonstrate its feasibility. At its core, Irec uses a dynamic knowledge graph of the user's learning history. When a user faces a new problem, a hybrid retrieval engine recalls relevant personal \"insights.\" Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) performs a deep similarity assessment to filter and present the most relevant scaffold in a just-in-time manner. To reduce cognitive load, Irec features a human-in-the-loop pipeline for LLM-based knowledge graph construction. We also propose an optional \"Guided Inquiry\" module, where users can engage in a Socratic dialogue with an expert LLM, using the current problem and recalled insights as context.

Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series inputs.

Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.

However, heuristic UQ approaches lack formal guarantees for key metrics such as the false discovery rate (FDR) in selective prediction. Previous work adopts the split conformal prediction (SCP) framework to ensure desired coverage of admissible answers by constructing prediction sets, but these sets often contain incorrect candidates, limiting their practical utility. To address this, we propose COIN, an uncertainty-guarding selection framework that calibrates statistically valid thresholds to filter a single generated answer per question under user-specified FDR constraints. COIN estimates the empirical error rate on a calibration set and applies confidence interval methods such as Clopper-Pearson to establish a high-probability upper bound on the true error rate (i.e., FDR). This enables the selection of the largest uncertainty threshold that ensures FDR control on test data while significantly increasing sample retention. We demonstrate COIN's robustness in risk control, strong test-time power in retaining admissible answers, and predictive efficiency under limited calibration data across both general and multimodal text generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that employing alternative upper bound constructions and UQ strategies can further boost COIN's power performance, which underscores its extensibility and adaptability to diverse application scenarios.",

To create supervised ground-truth HRMS images, synthetic data generated using the Wald protocol is commonly employed. This protocol assumes that networks trained on artificial low-resolution data will perform equally well on high-resolution data. However, well-trained models typically exhibit a trade-off in performance between reduced-resolution and full-resolution datasets. In this paper, we delve into the Wald protocol and find that its inaccurate approximation of real-world degradation patterns limits the generalization of deep pansharpening models. To address this issue, we propose the Progressive Alignment Degradation Module (PADM), which uses mutual iteration between two sub-networks, PAlignNet and PDegradeNet, to adaptively learn accurate degradation processes without relying on predefined operators. Building on this, we introduce HFreqdiff, which embeds high-frequency details into a diffusion framework and incorporates CFB and BACM modules for frequency-selective detail extraction and precise reverse process learning.

While the community has largely addressed this issue from a label-based perspective, identifying data points in the sequence affected by the priming effect, the impact of priming on data itself, particularly in physiological signals, remains underexplored. Data affected by priming can lead to misclassifications when used in learning models. This study proposes the Affective Priming Score (APS), a data-driven method to detect data points influenced by the priming effect. The APS assigns a score to each data point, quantifying the extent to which it is affected by priming. To validate this method, we apply it to the SEED and SEED-VII datasets, which contain sufficient transitions between emotional events to exhibit priming effects. We train models with the same configuration using both the original data and priming-free sequences. The misclassification rate is significantly reduced when using priming-free sequences compared to the original data.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20209v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP), common approaches for handling human disagreement consist of aggregating annotators' viewpoints to establish a single ground truth. However, prior studies show that disregarding individual opinions can lead can lead to the side effect of underrepresenting minority perspectives, especially in subjective tasks, where annotators may systematically disagree because of their preferences. Recognizing that labels reflect the diverse backgrounds, life experiences, and values of individuals, this study proposes a new multi-perspective approach using soft labels to encourage the development of the next generation of perspective aware models, more inclusive and pluralistic. We conduct an extensive analysis across diverse subjective text classification tasks, including hate speech, irony, abusive language, and stance detection, to highlight the importance of capturing human disagreements, often overlooked by traditional aggregation methods. Results show that the multi-perspective approach not only better approximates human label distributions, as measured by Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), but also achieves superior classification performance (higher F1 scores), outperforming traditional approaches. However, our approach exhibits lower confidence in tasks like irony and stance detection, likely due to the inherent subjectivity present in the texts. Lastly, leveraging Explainable AI (XAI), we explore model uncertainty and uncover meaningful insights into model predictions.",

In this work, we propose a novel graph neural network (GNN) framework to fuse feature embedding with community information. We theoretically demonstrate that such hybrid features can improve the performance of directed link prediction. To utilize such features efficiently, we also propose an approach to transform input graphs into directed line graphs so that nodes in the transformed graph can aggregate more information during graph convolutions.

However, these models still encounter difficulties when performing complex reasoning tasks involving logical deduction and systematic planning, primarily due to their reliance on implicit statistical relationships without structured knowledge representation.Inspired by cognitive science and neurosymbolic AI, we introduce a novel approach to enhance LLMs through explicit structured reasoning. First, we convert unstructured data into structured formats by explicitly annotating reasoning steps. We then employ this structured dataset to train LLMs through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Additionally, we enhance the structured reasoning capabilities of LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), incorporating two innovative algorithms--MAX-Flow and Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)--which notably improve reasoning effectiveness and reduce computational complexity. Experimental results from fine-tuning a DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model demonstrate concise reasoning, robust performance across various scenarios, and improved compatibility with optimization techniques, validating the efficacy of structured reasoning integration in LLMs.",

It provides a solution to the issues of isolated data islands and data privacy leakage in industrial ML practices. One major challenge in FL is handling the non-identical and independent distributed (non-IID) data. Current solutions either focus on constructing an all-powerful global model, or customizing personalized local models. Few of them can provide both a well-generalized global model and well-performed local models at the same time. Additionally, many FL solutions to the non-IID problem are benefited from introducing public datasets. However, this will also increase the risk of data leakage. To tackle the problems, we propose a novel data-free distillation framework, Federated Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD). Specifically, we train Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for synthetic data. During the GAN training, local models serve as discriminators and their parameters are frozen. The synthetic data is then used for bidirectional distillation between global and local models to achieve knowledge interactions so that performances for both sides are improved. We conduct extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks under different non-IID settings. The results show that FedBKD achieves SOTA performances in every case.",

Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of individual power consumption.\n  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20260v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs. Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e., the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20307v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Imitation learning is a central problem in reinforcement learning where the goal is to learn a policy that mimics the expert's behavior. In practice, it is often challenging to learn the expert policy from a limited number of demonstrations accurately due to the complexity of the state space. Moreover, it is essential to explore the environment and collect data to achieve beyond-expert performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel imitation learning algorithm called Imitation Learning with Double Exploration (ILDE), which implements exploration in two aspects: (1) optimistic policy optimization via an exploration bonus that rewards state-action pairs with high uncertainty to potentially improve the convergence to the expert policy, and (2) curiosity-driven exploration of the states that deviate from the demonstration trajectories to potentially yield beyond-expert performance. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILDE outperforms the state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithms in terms of sample efficiency and achieves beyond-expert performance on Atari and MuJoCo tasks with fewer demonstrations than in previous work. We also provide a theoretical justification of ILDE as an uncertainty-regularized policy optimization method with optimistic exploration, leading to a regret growing sublinearly in the number of episodes.",

At test time, hallucination streams infer missing cues, enriching feature representations without increasing computational overhead. To focus on action-relevant regions beyond raw pixels, we introduce two novel domain-specific descriptors.

However, existing SVD-based methods focus on the overall discrepancy between the original and compressed matrices while overlooking the protection of critical components within the matrix, which leads to inferior performance in the compressed models. This paper proposes a dual-level importance protection mechanism to enhance SVD-based compression methods: (1) local importance protection: preserving the most critical singular vectors within each weight matrix through channel-weighted data whitening; and (2) global importance protection: enabling less important layers to bear a greater portion of the compression burden through either a heuristic or optimization-based approach, thereby minimizing the impact of compression on critical layers.

Our solution employs a lightweight, fully decentralized algorithm to privately detect client similarity and form collaborative groups. Within each group, clients leverage differentially private knowledge distillation to co-train their models, maintaining high accuracy while ensuring robustness to the presence of malicious clients. We evaluate P4 on popular benchmark datasets using both linear and CNN-based architectures across various heterogeneity settings and attack scenarios. Experimental results show that P4 achieves 5% to 30% higher accuracy than leading differentially private peer-to-peer approaches and maintains robustness with up to 30% malicious clients.

Our estimator is the first to exploit these time-related structures via a new type of importance weighting, enabling effective F-OPE. Theoretical analysis identifies the conditions under which OPFV becomes low-bias.

This work addresses this challenge by presenting an algorithm to automatically select a reasonable number of required demonstrations. Our method distinguishes itself by integrating not only the tabular data's distribution but also the user's selected prompt template and the specific Large Language Model (LLM) into its estimation. Rooted in Spectral Graph Theory, our proposed algorithm defines a novel metric to quantify the similarities between different demonstrations. We then construct a similarity graph and analyze the eigenvalues of its Laplacian to derive the minimum number of demonstrations capable of representing the data within the LLM's intrinsic representation space. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments comparing its performance against conventional random selection algorithms on diverse datasets and LLMs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20481v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Machine learning models are known to memorize samples from their training data, raising concerns around privacy and generalization. Counterfactual self-influence is a popular metric to study memorization, quantifying how the model's prediction for a sample changes depending on the sample's inclusion in the training dataset. However, recent work has shown memorization to be affected by factors beyond self-influence, with other training samples, in particular (near-)duplicates, having a large impact. We here study memorization treating counterfactual influence as a distributional quantity, taking into account how all training samples influence how a sample is memorized. For a small language model, we compute the full influence distribution of training samples on each other and analyze its properties. We find that solely looking at self-influence can severely underestimate tangible risks associated with memorization: the presence of (near-)duplicates seriously reduces self-influence, while we find these samples to be (near-)extractable. We observe similar patterns for image classification, where simply looking at the influence distributions reveals the presence of near-duplicates in CIFAR-10. Our findings highlight that memorization stems from complex interactions across training data and is better captured by the full influence distribution than by self-influence alone.",

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements.

What makes a base language model suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance, while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen. We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens (i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).",

A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual, multi-task setting.\n  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages. We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0 improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented languages.",

These images are widely shared across Online Social Networks (OSNs), raising concerns about their misuse. Existing deepfake detection methods overlook the ``block effects\" introduced by compression in OSNs, which obscure deepfake artifacts, and primarily focus on raw images, rarely encountered in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose PLADA (Pay Less Attention to Deceptive Artifacts), a novel framework designed to tackle the lack of paired data and the ineffective use of compressed images. PLADA consists of two core modules: Block Effect Eraser (B2E), which uses a dual-stage attention mechanism to handle block effects, and Open Data Aggregation (ODA), which processes both paired and unpaired data to improve detection. Extensive experiments across 26 datasets demonstrate that PLADA achieves a remarkable balance in deepfake detection, outperforming SoTA methods in detecting deepfakes on OSNs, even with limited paired data and compression. More importantly, this work introduces the ``block effect\" as a critical factor in deepfake detection, providing a robust solution for open-world scenarios.

We design a novel and high-efficiency architecture, DeepQuark, to address the unique challenges in multiquark systems such as stronger correlations, extra discrete quantum numbers, and intractable confinement interaction. Our method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art approaches, including diffusion Monte Carlo and Gaussian expansion method, in the nucleon, doubly heavy tetraquark, and fully heavy tetraquark systems. Notably, it outperforms existing calculations for pentaquarks, exemplified by the triply heavy pentaquark. For the nucleon, we successfully incorporate three-body flux-tube confinement interactions without additional computational costs. In tetraquark systems, we consistently describe hadronic molecule $T_{cc}$ and compact tetraquark $T_{bb}$ with an unbiased form of wave function ansatz. In the pentaquark sector, we obtain weakly bound $\\bar D^*\\Xi_{cc}^*$ molecule $P_{cc\\bar c}(5715)$ with $S=\\frac{5}{2}$ and its bottom partner $P_{bb\\bar b}(15569)$. They can be viewed as the analogs of the molecular $T_{cc}$. We recommend experimental search of $P_{cc\\bar c}(5715)$ in the D-wave $J/\\psi \\Lambda_c$ channel. DeepQuark holds great promise for extension to larger multiquark systems, overcoming the computational barriers in conventional methods.

Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for this event proposal.

However, a critical gap persists between theoretical advancements and practical application, particularly in structured data like network traffic, where interdependent features complicate effective adversarial manipulations. Moreover, ambiguity in current approaches restricts reproducibility and limits progress in this field. Hence, existing defenses often fail to handle evolving adversarial attacks. This paper proposes a novel approach for black-box adversarial attacks, that addresses these limitations. Unlike prior work, which often assumes system access or relies on repeated probing, our method strictly respect black-box constraints, reducing interaction to avoid detection and better reflect real-world scenarios. We present an adaptive feature selection strategy using change-point detection and causality analysis to identify and target sensitive features to perturbations. This lightweight design ensures low computational cost and high deployability. Our comprehensive experiments show the attack's effectiveness in evading detection with minimal interaction, enhancing its adaptability and applicability in real-world scenarios. By advancing the understanding of adversarial attacks in network traffic, this work lays a foundation for developing robust defenses.",

Despite promising results were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within two stages. For the ``partition\" stage, a whole event proposal is split into short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization\" stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We particularly focus on the ``summarization\" stage, and propose a framework that effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization. We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN and LSTM.

We propose and evaluate machine learning frameworks, including Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as a baseline and a more advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture for joint gunshot detection and gun type classification. Results indicate that our deep learning approach achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.58 on clean labeled data, outperforming the SVM baseline (mAP 0.39). Challenges related to data quality, environmental noise, and the generalization capabilities when using noisy web-sourced data (mAP 0.35) are also discussed.

However, the lack of resolution and the presence of noise in these biomarkers are significant issues. As indicated by recent studies, it appears that biomarkers such as wall shear stress are particularly impacted by the poor resolution of vessel segmentation. The Phase Contrast Magnetic Resonance Angiography (PC-MRA) is the state-of-the-art method to facilitate segmentation.

This feature, termed Weighted Mean Frequencies (WMF), is capable of revealing the region in three dimensions where a voxel has been passed by pulsatile flow. Indeed, this feature is representative of the hull of all pulsatile velocity voxels. The value of the feature under discussion is illustrated by two experiments. The experiments involved segmenting 4D Flow MRI images using optimal thresholding and deep learning methods. The results obtained demonstrate a substantial enhancement in terms of IoU and Dice, with a respective increase of 0.12 and 0.13 in comparison with the PC-MRA feature, as evidenced by the deep learning task.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.20666v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Navigating everyday social situations often requires juggling conflicting goals, such as conveying a harsh truth, maintaining trust, all while still being mindful of another person's feelings. These value trade-offs are an integral part of human decision-making and language use, however, current tools for interpreting such dynamic and multi-faceted notions of values in LLMs are limited. In cognitive science, so-called \"cognitive models\" provide formal accounts of these trade-offs in humans, by modeling the weighting of a speaker's competing utility functions in choosing an action or utterance. In this work, we use a leading cognitive model of polite speech to interpret the extent to which LLMs represent human-like trade-offs. We apply this lens to systematically evaluate value trade-offs in two encompassing model settings: degrees of reasoning \"effort\" in frontier black-box models, and RL post-training dynamics of open-source models. Our results highlight patterns of higher informational utility than social utility in reasoning models, and in open-source models shown to be stronger in mathematical reasoning. Our findings from LLMs' training dynamics suggest large shifts in utility values early on in training with persistent effects of the choice of base model and pretraining data, compared to feedback dataset or alignment method. We show that our method is responsive to diverse aspects of the rapidly evolving LLM landscape, with insights for forming hypotheses about other high-level behaviors, shaping training regimes for reasoning models, and better controlling trade-offs between values during model training.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.11898v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) attempts to predict missing facts in a Knowledge Graph (KG). Recently, there's been an increased focus on designing KGC methods that can excel in the inductive setting, where a portion or all of the entities and relations seen in inference are unobserved during training. Numerous benchmark datasets have been proposed for inductive KGC, all of which are subsets of existing KGs used for transductive KGC. However, we find that the current procedure for constructing inductive KGC datasets inadvertently creates a shortcut that can be exploited even while disregarding the relational information. Specifically, we observe that the Personalized PageRank (PPR) score can achieve strong or near SOTA performance on most datasets. In this paper, we study the root cause of this problem. Using these insights, we propose an alternative strategy for constructing inductive KGC datasets that helps mitigate the PPR shortcut. We then benchmark multiple popular methods using the newly constructed datasets and analyze their performance. The new benchmark datasets help promote a better understanding of the capabilities and challenges of inductive KGC by removing any shortcuts that obfuscate performance.

We propose an Automated Model Merging Framework that enables fine-grained exploration of merging strategies while reducing costs through multi-fidelity approximations. We support both single and multi-objective optimization and introduce two novel search spaces: layerwise fusion (LFS) and depth-wise integration (DIS). Evaluating across a number of benchmarks, we find that the search autonomously finds 1) Merges that further boost single-objective performance, even on tasks the model has already been finetuned on, and 2) Merges that optimize multi-objective frontiers across tasks.

Moreover, the trial-and-error nature of the PT process is constrained by existing frameworks lacking mechanisms to learn from previous failures, restricting adaptive improvement of PT strategies. To address these limitations, we propose a knowledge-informed, self-reflective PT framework powered by LLMs, called RefPentester. This AutoPT framework is designed to assist human operators in identifying the current stage of the PT process, selecting appropriate tactics and techniques for each stage, choosing suggested actions, providing step-by-step operational guidance, and reflecting on and learning from previous failed operations. We also modeled the PT process as a seven-state Stage Machine to integrate the proposed framework effectively.

Current research typically evaluates agents via multi-turn dialogues. However, it overlooks the influence of these critical factors on agent behavior. To bridge this gap, we present an open-source and high-quality benchmark $C^3$-Bench. This benchmark integrates attack concepts and applies univariate analysis to pinpoint key elements affecting agent robustness. In concrete, we design three challenges: navigate complex tool relationships, handle critical hidden information and manage dynamic decision paths. Complementing these challenges, we introduce fine-grained metrics, innovative data collection algorithms and reproducible evaluation methods. Extensive experiments are conducted on 49 mainstream agents, encompassing general fast-thinking, slow-thinking and domain-specific models. We observe that agents have significant shortcomings in handling tool dependencies, long context information dependencies and frequent policy-type switching.

In this work, we discuss why traditional methods like the Turing test do not suffice for measuring or detecting A.G.I. and provide a new, practical method that can be used to decide if a system (computer or any other) has reached or surpassed A.G.I. To achieve this, we make two new contributions. First, we present a clear definition for general intelligence (G.I.) and set a G.I. Threshold (G.I.T.) that can be used to distinguish between systems that achieve A.G.I. and systems that do not. Second, we present a new framework on how to construct tests that can detect if a system has achieved G.I. in a simple, comprehensive, and clear-cut fail/pass way.

This paper introduces a novel hybrid framework that integrates RAG with intent-based canned responses, leveraging predefined high-confidence responses for efficiency while dynamically routing complex or ambiguous queries to the RAG pipeline. Our framework employs a dialogue context manager to ensure coherence in multi-turn interactions and incorporates a feedback loop to refine intents, dynamically adjust confidence thresholds, and expand response coverage over time.

We first establish The Enumeration Paradox: we use machine learning precisely because we cannot enumerate all necessary safety rules, yet making ML safe requires examples that can only be generated from the very enumeration we admit is impossible. This paradox is then confirmed by a set of five independent mathematical proofs, or \"pillars of impossibility.\" Our main results show that: (1) Geometric Impossibility: The set of safe policies has measure zero, a necessary consequence of projecting infinite-dimensional world-context requirements onto finite-dimensional models. (2) Computational Impossibility: Verifying a policy's safety is coNP-complete, even for non-zero error tolerances. (3) Statistical Impossibility: The training data required for safety (abundant examples of rare disasters) is a logical contradiction and thus unobtainable. (4) Information-Theoretic Impossibility: Safety rules contain more incompressible, arbitrary information than any feasible network can store. (5) Dynamic Impossibility: The optimization process for increasing AI capability is actively hostile to safety, as the gradients for the two objectives are generally anti-aligned. Together, these results demonstrate that the pursuit of safe, highly capable AI is not a matter of overcoming technical hurdles, but of confronting fundamental, interlocking barriers. The paper concludes by presenting a strategic trilemma that these impossibilities force upon the field. A formal verification of the core theorems in Lean4 is currently in progress.",

Nevertheless, suggestibility inherited via human feedback improves the inclination to produce answers corresponding to users' viewpoints. This behaviour is known as sycophancy and depicts the tendency of LLMs to generate misleading responses as long as they align with humans. This phenomenon induces bias and reduces the robustness and, consequently, the reliability of these models. In this paper, we study the suggestibility of Large Language Models (LLMs) to sycophantic behaviour, analysing these tendencies via systematic human-interventions prompts over different tasks. Our investigation demonstrates that LLMs have sycophantic tendencies when answering queries that involve subjective opinions and statements that should elicit a contrary response based on facts.

Concept-based models that fail to respect localities also fail to be explainable because concept predictions are based on spurious features, making the interpretation of the concept predictions vacuous. To assess whether concept-based models respect localities, we construct and use three metrics to characterize when models respect localities, complementing our analysis with theoretical results. Each of our metrics captures a different notion of perturbation and assess whether perturbing \"irrelevant\" features impacts the predictions made by a concept predictors.

Recently, language-aligned foundation models (LFMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable image and text data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing foundation models for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where large, richly annotated datasets are available. However, the X-ray imaging modality features highly variable image appearance and applications, from diagnostic chest X-rays to interventional fluoroscopy, with varying availability of data. To pave the way toward an LFM for comprehensive and language-aligned analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we introduce FluoroSAM, a language-promptable variant of the Segment Anything Model, trained from scratch on 3M synthetic X-ray images from a wide variety of human anatomies, imaging geometries, and viewing angles.

FluoroSAM is capable of segmenting myriad anatomical structures and tools based on natural language prompts, thanks to the novel incorporation of vector quantization (VQ) of text embeddings in the training process.

Their performance is significantly impacted by the conflicting optimization objectives of imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL), sample inefficiency, and the complexity of uncovering the hidden world model and physics. To address this challenge, we propose a physics-informed IRL that is entirely data-driven. It leverages both expert demonstration data and exploratory data with a joint optimization objective, allowing the underlying physical principles of vehicle dynamics to emerge naturally from the training process. The performance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed popular IL, RL and IRL algorithms in closed-loop settings on Waymax benchmark. Our approach exhibits 37.8% reduction in collision rate and 22.2% reduction in off-road rate compared to the baseline method.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2407.21049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As language models support larger and larger context sizes, evaluating their ability to make effective use of that context becomes increasingly important. We analyze the ability of several code generation models to handle long range dependencies using a suite of multi-step key retrieval tasks in context windows up to 8k tokens in length. The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly for many models (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x. Our analysis highlights ways that long-context performance needs deeper consideration beyond retrieval of single facts within a document.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2408.00523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation by transforming textual descriptions into high-quality images. However, these models are vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks, where carefully crafted prompts bypass safety mechanisms to produce unsafe content. While researchers have developed various jailbreak attacks to expose this risk, these methods face significant limitations, including impractical access requirements, easily detectable unnatural prompts, restricted search spaces, and high query demands on the target system. In this paper, we propose JailFuzzer, a novel fuzzing framework driven by large language model (LLM) agents, designed to efficiently generate natural and semantically meaningful jailbreak prompts in a black-box setting. Specifically, JailFuzzer employs fuzz-testing principles with three components: a seed pool for initial and jailbreak prompts, a guided mutation engine for generating meaningful variations, and an oracle function to evaluate jailbreak success. Furthermore, we construct the guided mutation engine and oracle function by LLM-based agents, which further ensures efficiency and adaptability in black-box settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JailFuzzer has significant advantages in jailbreaking T2I models. It generates natural and semantically coherent prompts, reducing the likelihood of detection by traditional defenses. Additionally, it achieves a high success rate in jailbreak attacks with minimal query overhead, outperforming existing methods across all key metrics. This study underscores the need for stronger safety mechanisms in generative models and provides a foundation for future research on defending against sophisticated jailbreaking attacks.

    "summary": "arXiv:2408.16767v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Advancements in 3D scene reconstruction have transformed 2D images from the real world into 3D models, producing realistic 3D results from hundreds of input photos. Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios, rendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an ill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in unseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction paradigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal generation task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of large pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction. However, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly generated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited input views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and encodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the condition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are both detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the coherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D scene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets show the superiority of our ReconX over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quality and generalizability.",

During this learning, they execute frequent eye and head movements that shape their visual experience. It is presently unclear if and how these behaviors contribute to toddlers' emerging object recognition abilities. To answer this question, we here combine head-mounted eye tracking during dyadic play with unsupervised machine learning. We approximate toddlers' central visual field experience by cropping image regions from a head-mounted camera centered on the current gaze location estimated via eye tracking. This visual stream feeds an unsupervised computational model of toddlers' learning, which constructs visual representations that slowly change over time. Our experiments demonstrate that toddlers' gaze strategy supports the learning of invariant object representations. Our analysis also shows that the limited size of the central visual field where acuity is high is crucial for this. Overall, our work reveals how toddlers' gaze behavior may support their development of view-invariant object recognition.",

In this paper, we address this question by analyzing latent representations (latents) during a word-translation task in transformer-based LLMs. We strategically extract latents from a source translation prompt and insert them into the forward pass on a target translation prompt. By doing so, we find that the output language is encoded in the latent at an earlier layer than the concept to be translated. Building on this insight, we conduct two key experiments. First, we demonstrate that we can change the concept without changing the language and vice versa through activation patching alone. Second, we show that patching with the mean representation of a concept across different languages does not affect the models' ability to translate it, but instead improves it. Finally, we generalize to multi-token generation and demonstrate that the model can generate natural language description of those mean representations. Our results provide evidence for the existence of language-agnostic concept representations within the investigated models.",

Previous spike-based 3D reconstruction approaches often employ a casecased pipeline: starting with high-quality image reconstruction from spike streams based on established spike-to-image reconstruction algorithms, then progressing to camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, this cascaded approach suffers from substantial cumulative errors, where quality limitations of initial image reconstructions negatively impact pose estimation, ultimately degrading the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address these issues, we propose a synergistic optimization framework, \\textbf{USP-Gaussian}, that unifies spike-based image reconstruction, pose correction, and Gaussian splatting into an end-to-end framework. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera, our framework enables a joint iterative optimization that seamlessly integrates information between the spike-to-image network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets with accurate poses demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors. Moreover, we integrate pose optimization to achieve robust 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios with inaccurate initial poses, outperforming alternative methods by effectively reducing noise and preserving fine texture details.

Generally, world models are regarded as tools for either understanding the present state of the world or predicting its future dynamics. This review presents a systematic categorization of world models, emphasizing two primary functions: (1) constructing internal representations to understand the mechanisms of the world, and (2) predicting future states to simulate and guide decision-making. Initially, we examine the current progress in these two categories. We then explore the application of world models in key domains, including autonomous driving, robotics, and social simulacra, with a focus on how each domain utilizes these aspects.

In HRI, complex command (action) classification is still an open problem that usually prevents the real applicability of such a technique. The literature presents some works that use neural networks to detect these actions. However, occlusion is still a major issue in HRI, especially when using uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), since, during the robot's movement, the human operator is often out of the robot's field of view. Furthermore, in multi-robot scenarios, distributed training is also an open problem. In this sense, this work proposes an action recognition and control approach based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Neural Networks with two layers in association with three densely connected layers and Federated Learning (FL) embedded in multiple drones. The FL enabled our approach to be trained in a distributed fashion, i.e., access to data without the need for cloud or other repositories, which facilitates the multi-robot system's learning. Furthermore, our multi-robot approach results also prevented occlusion situations, with experiments with real robots achieving an accuracy greater than 96%.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.03905v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.",

However, existing backdoor attacks are typically designed to resist a specific type of backdoor defense without considering the diverse range of defense mechanisms. Based on this observation, we pose a natural question: Are current backdoor attacks truly a real-world threat when facing diverse practical defenses?\n  To answer this question, we examine 12 common backdoor attacks that focus on input-space or feature-space stealthiness and 17 diverse representative defenses. Surprisingly, we reveal a critical blind spot: Backdoor attacks designed to be stealthy in input and feature spaces can be mitigated by examining backdoored models in parameter space. To investigate the underlying causes behind this common vulnerability, we study the characteristics of backdoor attacks in the parameter space. Notably, we find that input- and feature-space attacks introduce prominent backdoor-related neurons in parameter space, which are not thoroughly considered by current backdoor attacks. Taking comprehensive stealthiness into account, we propose a novel supply-chain attack called Grond. Grond limits the parameter changes by a simple yet effective module, Adversarial Backdoor Injection (ABI), which adaptively increases the parameter-space stealthiness during the backdoor injection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Grond outperforms all 12 backdoor attacks against state-of-the-art (including adaptive) defenses on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and a subset of ImageNet. In addition, we show that ABI consistently improves the effectiveness of common backdoor attacks.",

While ICL offers fast adaptation across natural language tasks and domains, its emergence is less straightforward for modalities beyond text. In this work, we systematically uncover properties present in LLMs that support the emergence of ICL for autoregressive models and various modalities by promoting the learning of the needed mechanisms for ICL. We identify exact token repetitions in the training data sequences as an important factor for ICL. Such repetitions further improve stability and reduce transiency in ICL performance. Moreover, we emphasise the significance of training task difficulty for the emergence of ICL. Finally, by applying our novel insights on ICL emergence, we unlock ICL capabilities for various visual datasets and a more challenging EEG classification task in a few-shot learning regime.",

In this paper, we present a novel variational formulation of the calibration-refinement decomposition that sheds new light on post-hoc calibration, and enables rapid estimation of the different terms. Equipped with this new perspective, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that calibration and refinement errors are not minimized simultaneously during training. Selecting the best epoch based on validation loss thus leads to a compromise point that is suboptimal for both terms. To address this, we propose minimizing refinement error only during training (Refine,...), before minimizing calibration error post hoc, using standard techniques (...then Calibrate).

This trade-off arises because IFT steers LLMs to generate responses containing long-tail knowledge that was not well covered during pre-training. As a result, models become more informative but less accurate when generalizing to unseen tasks. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate how unfamiliar knowledge in IFT datasets can negatively affect the truthfulness of LLMs, and we introduce two new IFT paradigms, $UNIT_{cut}$ and $UNIT_{ref}$, to address this issue. $UNIT_{cut}$ identifies and removes unfamiliar knowledge from IFT datasets to mitigate its impact on model truthfulness, whereas $UNIT_{ref}$ trains LLMs to recognize their uncertainty and explicitly indicate it at the end of their responses. Our experiments show that $UNIT_{cut}$ substantially improves LLM truthfulness, while $UNIT_{ref}$ maintains high informativeness and reduces hallucinations by distinguishing between confident and uncertain statements.",

However, in contrast to this need for confidentiality, the current standard training paradigm for machine learning-based retrosynthesis gathers reaction data from multiple sources into one single edge to train prediction models. This paradigm poses considerable privacy risks as it necessitates broad data availability across organizational boundaries and frequent data transmission between entities, potentially exposing proprietary information to unauthorized access or interception during storage and transfer. In the present study, we introduce the chemical knowledge-informed framework (CKIF), a privacy-preserving approach for learning retrosynthesis models. CKIF enables distributed training across multiple chemical organizations without compromising the confidentiality of proprietary reaction data. Instead of gathering raw reaction data, CKIF learns retrosynthesis models through iterative, chemical knowledge-informed aggregation of model parameters. In particular, the chemical properties of predicted reactants are leveraged to quantitatively assess the observable behaviors of individual models, which in turn determines the adaptive weights used for model aggregation. On a variety of reaction datasets, CKIF outperforms several strong baselines by a clear margin.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.00089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.00845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Despite significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), developing advanced reasoning capabilities in LLMs remains a key challenge. Process Reward Models (PRMs) have demonstrated exceptional promise in enhancing reasoning by providing step-wise feedback, particularly in the context of mathematical reasoning. However, their application to broader reasoning domains remains understudied, largely due to the high costs associated with manually creating step-level supervision. In this work, we explore the potential of PRMs in graph reasoning problems - a domain that demands sophisticated multi-step reasoning and offers opportunities for automated step-level data generation using established graph algorithms. We introduce GraphSILO, the largest dataset for graph reasoning problems with fine-grained step-wise labels, built using automated Task-oriented Trajectories and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate detailed reasoning steps with step-wise labels. Building upon this dataset, we train GraphPRM, the first PRM designed for graph reasoning problems, and evaluate its effectiveness in two key settings: inference-time scaling and reinforcement learning via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that GraphPRM significantly improves LLM performance across 13 graph reasoning tasks, delivering a 9% gain for Qwen2.5-7B and demonstrating transferability to new graph reasoning datasets and new reasoning domains like mathematical problem-solving. Notably, GraphPRM enhances LLM performance on GSM8K and Math500, underscoring the cross-domain applicability of graph-based reasoning rewards. Our findings highlight the potential of PRMs in advancing reasoning across diverse domains, paving the way for more versatile and effective LLMs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.05319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: This paper discusses how ophthalmologists often rely on multimodal data to improve diagnostic accuracy. However, complete multimodal data is rare in real-world applications due to a lack of medical equipment and concerns about data privacy. Traditional deep learning methods typically address these issues by learning representations in latent space. However, the paper highlights two key limitations of these approaches: (i) Task-irrelevant redundant information (e.g., numerous slices) in complex modalities leads to significant redundancy in latent space representations. (ii) Overlapping multimodal representations make it difficult to extract unique features for each modality. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose the Essence-Point and Disentangle Representation Learning (EDRL) strategy, which integrates a self-distillation mechanism into an end-to-end framework to enhance feature selection and disentanglement for more robust multimodal learning. Specifically, the Essence-Point Representation Learning module selects discriminative features that improve disease grading performance. The Disentangled Representation Learning module separates multimodal data into modality-common and modality-unique representations, reducing feature entanglement and enhancing both robustness and interpretability in ophthalmic disease diagnosis. Experiments on multimodal ophthalmology datasets show that the proposed EDRL strategy significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.",

We present the first investigation of knowledge distillation (KD) from classical to quantum vision transformers in biomedical image classification, showing that QViTs maintain comparable performance to classical ViTs across eight diverse datasets spanning multiple modalities, with improved QSA parameter-efficiency.

Our dataset includes 1,045 high-quality point clouds of field-grown maize collected using a terrestrial laser scanner (TLS). Point clouds of 520 plants from this dataset were segmented and annotated using a graph-based segmentation method to isolate individual leaves and stalks, ensuring consistent labeling across all samples. This labeled data was then used for fitting procedural models that provide a structured parametric representation of the maize plants. The leaves of the maize plants in the procedural models are represented using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) surfaces that were generated using a two-step optimization process combining gradient-free and gradient-based methods. We conducted rigorous manual quality control on all datasets, correcting errors in segmentation, ensuring accurate leaf ordering, and validating metadata annotations. The dataset also includes metadata detailing plant morphology and quality, alongside multi-resolution subsampled point cloud data (100k, 50k, 10k points), which can be readily used for different downstream computational tasks.

In this paper, we propose a way of modularizing knowledge by training document-level Knowledge Modules (KMs). KMs are lightweight components implemented as parameter-efficient LoRA modules, which are trained to store information about new documents and can be easily plugged into models on demand. We show that next-token prediction performs poorly as the training objective for KMs. We instead propose Deep Context Distillation: we learn KMs parameters such as to simulate hidden states and logits of a teacher that takes the document in context.

Similar to humans, large language models (LLMs) exhibit flexibility in handling textual positions - a phenomenon we term position generalization. They can understand texts with position perturbations and generalize to longer texts than those encountered during training with the latest techniques. These phenomena suggest that LLMs handle positions tolerantly, but how LLMs computationally process positional relevance remains largely unexplored. This work connects the linguistic phenomenon with LLMs' computational mechanisms. We show how LLMs enforce certain computational mechanisms for the aforementioned tolerance in position perturbations. Despite the complex design of the self-attention mechanism, this work reveals that LLMs learn a counterintuitive disentanglement of attention logits. Their values show a 0.959 linear correlation with an approximation of the arithmetic sum of positional relevance and semantic importance. Furthermore, we identify a prevalent pattern in intermediate features, which we prove theoretically enables this effect. The pattern, which is different from how randomly initialized parameters would behave, suggests that it is a learned behavior rather than a natural result of the model architecture. Based on these findings, we provide computational explanations and criteria for LLMs' position flexibilities. This work takes a pioneering step in linking position generalization with modern LLMs' internal mechanisms.",

Automated wound monitoring via mobile image capture can reduce in-person physician visits by enabling remote tracking of wound size. Semantic segmentation is key to this process, yet wound segmentation remains underrepresented in medical imaging research. To address this, we benchmark state-of-the-art deep learning models from general-purpose vision, medical imaging, and top methods from public wound challenges. For a fair comparison, we standardize training, data augmentation, and evaluation, conducting cross-validation to minimize partitioning bias. We also assess real-world deployment aspects, including generalization to an out-of-distribution wound dataset, computational efficiency, and interpretability. Additionally, we propose a reference object-based approach to convert AI-generated masks into clinically relevant wound size estimates and evaluate this, along with mask quality, for the five best architectures based on physician assessments. Overall, the transformer-based TransNeXt showed the highest levels of generalizability. Despite variations in inference times, all models processed at least one image per second on the CPU, which is deemed adequate for the intended application. Interpretability analysis typically revealed prominent activations in wound regions, emphasizing focus on clinically relevant features. Expert evaluation showed high mask approval for all analyzed models, with VWFormer and ConvNeXtS backbone performing the best.

Unlike traditional paradigms that strongly rely on encoder-based state embeddings, our framework decouples the network design, simplifying the policy network and deployment. A high performance teacher policy is first trained using privileged information to acquire generalizable motion skills. The teacher's motion distribution is transferred to the student policy, which relies only on noisy proprioceptive data, via a generative adversarial mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by distributional shifts. Additionally, auxiliary task learning enhances the student policy's feature representation, speeding up convergence and improving adaptability to varying terrains.

We introduce TSPulse, ultra-compact time-series pre-trained models with only 1M parameters, specialized to perform strongly across classification, anomaly detection, imputation, and retrieval tasks. TSPulse introduces innovations at both the architecture and task levels. At the architecture level, it employs a dual-space masked reconstruction, learning from both time and frequency domains to capture complementary signals. This is further enhanced by a dual-embedding disentanglement, generating both detailed embeddings for fine-grained analysis and high-level semantic embeddings for broader task understanding. Notably, TSPulse's semantic embeddings are robust to shifts in time, magnitude, and noise, which is important for robust retrieval. At the task level, TSPulse incorporates TSLens, a fine-tuning component enabling task-specific feature attention. It also introduces a multi-head triangulation technique that correlates deviations from multiple prediction heads, enhancing anomaly detection by fusing complementary model outputs. Additionally, a hybrid mask pretraining is proposed to improves zero-shot imputation by reducing pre-training bias. These architecture and task innovations collectively contribute to TSPulse's significant performance gains: 5-16% on the UEA classification benchmarks, +20% on the TSB-AD anomaly detection leaderboard, +50% in zero-shot imputation, and +25% in time-series retrieval. Remarkably, these results are achieved with just 1M parameters (10-100X smaller than existing SOTA models) and allow GPU-free inference, setting a new standard for efficient time-series pre-trained models.

While TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable and stable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification.

In practice, pre-training has been relying on massive web crawls, using almost all data sources publicly available on the internet so far. However, this pool of natural data does not grow at the same rate as the compute supply. Furthermore, the availability of high-quality texts is even more limited: data filtering pipelines often remove up to 99% of the initial web scrapes to achieve state-of-the-art. To address the \"data wall\" of pre-training scaling, our work explores ways to transform and recycle data discarded in existing filtering processes. We propose REWIRE, REcycling the Web with guIded REwrite, a method to enrich low-quality documents so that they could become useful for training. This in turn allows us to increase the representation of synthetic data in the final pre-training set. Experiments at 1B, 3B and 7B scales of the DCLM benchmark show that mixing high-quality raw texts and our rewritten texts lead to 1.0, 1.3 and 2.5 percentage points improvement respectively across 22 diverse tasks, compared to training on only filtered web data. Training on the raw-synthetic data mix is also more effective than having access to 2x web data. Through further analysis, we demonstrate that about 82% of the mixed in texts come from transforming lower-quality documents that would otherwise be discarded. REWIRE also outperforms related approaches of generating synthetic data, including Wikipedia-style paraphrasing, question-answer synthesizing and knowledge extraction. These results suggest that recycling web texts holds the potential for being a simple and effective approach for scaling pre-training data.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.07744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Existing offline hierarchical reinforcement learning methods rely on high-level policy learning to generate subgoal sequences. However, their efficiency degrades as task horizons increase, and they lack effective strategies for stitching useful state transitions across different trajectories. We propose Graph-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel framework that formulates subgoal selection as a graph search problem rather than learning an explicit high-level policy. By embedding states into a Temporal Distance Representation (TDR) space, GAS clusters semantically similar states from different trajectories into unified graph nodes, enabling efficient transition stitching. A shortest-path algorithm is then applied to select subgoal sequences within the graph, while a low-level policy learns to reach the subgoals. To improve graph quality, we introduce the Temporal Efficiency (TE) metric, which filters out noisy or inefficient transition states, significantly enhancing task performance. GAS outperforms prior offline HRL methods across locomotion, navigation, and manipulation tasks. Notably, in the most stitching-critical task, it achieves a score of 88.3, dramatically surpassing the previous state-of-the-art score of 1.0.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.10978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent guidance methods in diffusion models steer reverse sampling by perturbing the model to construct an implicit weak model and guide generation away from it. Among these approaches, attention perturbation has demonstrated strong empirical performance in unconditional scenarios where classifier-free guidance is not applicable. However, existing attention perturbation methods lack principled approaches for determining where perturbations should be applied, particularly in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architectures where quality-relevant computations are distributed across layers. In this paper, we investigate the granularity of attention perturbations, ranging from the layer level down to individual attention heads, and discover that specific heads govern distinct visual concepts such as structure, style, and texture quality. Building on this insight, we propose \"HeadHunter\", a systematic framework for iteratively selecting attention heads that align with user-centric objectives, enabling fine-grained control over generation quality and visual attributes. In addition, we introduce SoftPAG, which linearly interpolates each selected head's attention map toward an identity matrix, providing a continuous knob to tune perturbation strength and suppress artifacts. Our approach not only mitigates the oversmoothing issues of existing layer-level perturbation but also enables targeted manipulation of specific visual styles through compositional head selection. We validate our method on modern large-scale DiT-based text-to-image models including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1, demonstrating superior performance in both general quality enhancement and style-specific guidance. Our work provides the first head-level analysis of attention perturbation in diffusion models, uncovering interpretable specialization within attention layers and enabling practical design of effective perturbation strategies.",

For multi-arm robotic systems, IK remains challenging due to complex self-collisions, coupled joints, and high-dimensional redundancy. These complexities make traditional IK solvers slow, prone to failure, and lacking in solution diversity. In this paper, we present IKDiffuser, a diffusion-based model designed for fast and diverse IK solution generation for multi-arm robotic systems. IKDiffuser learns the joint distribution over the configuration space, capturing complex dependencies and enabling seamless generalization to multi-arm robotic systems of different structures. In addition, IKDiffuser can incorporate additional objectives during inference without retraining, offering versatility and adaptability for task-specific requirements. In experiments on 6 different multi-arm systems, the proposed IKDiffuser achieves superior solution accuracy, precision, diversity, and computational efficiency compared to existing solvers. The proposed IKDiffuser framework offers a scalable, unified approach to solving multi-arm IK problems, facilitating the potential of multi-arm robotic systems in real-time manipulation tasks.",

These agents are often fine-tuned on limited user-generated datasets, leaving them vulnerable to covert threats during the training process. In this work we present GHOST, the first clean-label backdoor attack specifically designed for mobile agents built upon VLMs. Our method manipulates only the visual inputs of a portion of the training samples - without altering their corresponding labels or instructions - thereby injecting malicious behaviors into the model. Once fine-tuned with this tampered data, the agent will exhibit attacker-controlled responses when a specific visual trigger is introduced at inference time. The core of our approach lies in aligning the gradients of poisoned samples with those of a chosen target instance, embedding backdoor-relevant features into the poisoned training data. To maintain stealth and enhance robustness, we develop three realistic visual triggers: static visual patches, dynamic motion cues, and subtle low-opacity overlays. We evaluate our method across six real-world Android apps and three VLM architectures adapted for mobile use. Results show that our attack achieves high attack success rates (up to 94.67 percent) while maintaining high clean-task performance (FSR up to 95.85 percent). Additionally, ablation studies shed light on how various design choices affect the efficacy and concealment of the attack. Overall, this work is the first to expose critical security flaws in VLM-based mobile agents, highlighting their susceptibility to clean-label backdoor attacks and the urgent need for effective defense mechanisms in their training pipelines.",

The estimator is modeled in either linear or quadratic form, allowing attribution of importance to individual features and their interactions. Empirical results on the Taxi-v3 environment demonstrate that VRAIL improves training stability and convergence compared to standard DQN, without requiring environment modifications. Further analysis shows that VRAIL uncovers semantically meaningful subgoals, such as passenger possession, highlighting its ability to produce human-interpretable behavior.

To address this, we introduce TabArena, the first continuously maintained living tabular benchmarking system. To launch TabArena, we manually curate a representative collection of datasets and well-implemented models, conduct a large-scale benchmarking study to initialize a public leaderboard, and assemble a team of experienced maintainers. Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning and investigate the contributions of individual models.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.17219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve reasoning. Approaches like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) have shown strong results, but they require extensive external supervision. We investigate an alternative class of methods, Reinforcement Learning from Internal Feedback (RLIF), which relies solely on intrinsic model-derived signals instead of external rewards. In particular, we leverage unsupervised reward proxies such as token-level entropy, trajectory-level entropy, and self-certainty. Our theoretical analysis shows these internal objectives are partially equivalent, and we empirically evaluate various RLIF strategies on challenging math reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that RLIF can boost the reasoning performance of base LLMs at the beginning phase of the training, matching or surpassing RLVR techniques on these tasks. However, when training progresses, performance degrades even below the model before training. Moreover, we find that RLIF yields little improvement for instruction-tuned models, indicating diminishing returns of intrinsic feedback once an LLM is already instruction-tuned. We further analyze this limitation by mixing model weights and explain the reason of RLIF's training behaviors, providing practical guidelines for integrating internal feedback signals into LLM training. We hope our analysis of internal feedback will inform more principled and effective strategies for LLM post-training.",

Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections.

We introduce Forward Interval Propagation (FIP), a method designed to tackle the challenges of non-linearity and the multi-layer composite structure in neural networks by discretizing activation functions into linear subintervals. This approach preserves the universal approximation properties of neural networks while allowing complex nonlinear functions to be optimized using quantum computers, thus broadening their applicability in artificial intelligence. We provide theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error and the number of Ising spins required, by deriving the sample complexity of the empirical risk minimization problem, from an optimization perspective. A significant challenge in solving the associated Quadratic Constrained Binary Optimization (QCBO) model on a large scale is the presence of numerous constraints. When employing the penalty method to handle these constraints, tuning a large number of penalty coefficients becomes a critical hyperparameter optimization problem, increasing computational complexity and potentially affecting solution quality. To address this, we employ the Quantum Conditional Gradient Descent (QCGD) algorithm, which leverages quantum computing to directly solve the QCBO problem. We prove the convergence of QCGD under a quantum oracle with randomness and bounded variance in objective value, as well as under limited precision constraints in the coefficient matrix.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.18251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In this paper, we present Morse, a simple dual-sampling framework for accelerating diffusion models losslessly. The key insight of Morse is to reformulate the iterative generation (from noise to data) process via taking advantage of fast jump sampling and adaptive residual feedback strategies. Specifically, Morse involves two models called Dash and Dot that interact with each other. The Dash model is just the pre-trained diffusion model of any type, but operates in a jump sampling regime, creating sufficient space for sampling efficiency improvement. The Dot model is significantly faster than the Dash model, which is learnt to generate residual feedback conditioned on the observations at the current jump sampling point on the trajectory of the Dash model, lifting the noise estimate to easily match the next-step estimate of the Dash model without jump sampling. By chaining the outputs of the Dash and Dot models run in a time-interleaved fashion, Morse exhibits the merit of flexibly attaining desired image generation performance while improving overall runtime efficiency. With our proposed weight sharing strategy between the Dash and Dot models, Morse is efficient for training and inference. Our method shows a lossless speedup of 1.78X to 3.31X on average over a wide range of sampling step budgets relative to 9 baseline diffusion models on 6 image generation tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can be also generalized to improve the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-SDXL, which is already accelerated with consistency distillation technique) tailored for few-step text-to-image synthesis.

To address these challenges, we propose FiSCo(Fine-grained Semantic Computation), a novel statistical framework to evaluate group-level fairness in LLMs by detecting subtle semantic differences in long-form responses across demographic groups. Unlike prior work focusing on sentiment or token-level comparisons, FiSCo goes beyond surface-level analysis by operating at the claim level, leveraging entailment checks to assess the consistency of meaning across responses. We decompose model outputs into semantically distinct claims and apply statistical hypothesis testing to compare inter- and intra-group similarities, enabling robust detection of subtle biases. We formalize a new group counterfactual fairness definition and validate FiSCo on both synthetic and human-annotated datasets spanning gender, race, and age. Experiments show that FiSco more reliably identifies nuanced biases while reducing the impact of stochastic LLM variability, outperforming various evaluation metrics.",

However, their long-form chain-of-thought reasoning creates interpretability challenges as each generated token depends on all previous ones, making the computation harder to decompose. We argue that analyzing reasoning traces at the sentence level is a promising approach to understanding reasoning processes. We present three complementary attribution methods: (1) a black-box method measuring each sentence's counterfactual importance by comparing final answers across 100 rollouts conditioned on the model generating that sentence or one with a different meaning; (2) a white-box method of aggregating attention patterns between pairs of sentences, which identified \"broadcasting\" sentences that receive disproportionate attention from all future sentences via \"receiver\" attention heads; (3) a causal attribution method measuring logical connections between sentences by suppressing attention toward one sentence and measuring the effect on each future sentence's tokens. Each method provides evidence for the existence of thought anchors, reasoning steps that have outsized importance and that disproportionately influence the subsequent reasoning process. These thought anchors are typically planning or backtracking sentences. We provide an open-source tool (www.thought-anchors.com) for visualizing the outputs of our methods, and present a case study showing converging patterns across methods that map how a model performs multi-step reasoning.

    "title": "AnchorDP3: 3D Affordance Guided Sparse Diffusion Policy for Robotic Manipulation",
    "summary": "arXiv:2506.19269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We present AnchorDP3, a diffusion policy framework for dual-arm robotic manipulation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in highly randomized environments. AnchorDP3 integrates three key innovations: (1) Simulator-Supervised Semantic Segmentation, using rendered ground truth to explicitly segment task-critical objects within the point cloud, which provides strong affordance priors; (2) Task-Conditioned Feature Encoders, lightweight modules processing augmented point clouds per task, enabling efficient multi-task learning through a shared diffusion-based action expert; (3) Affordance-Anchored Keypose Diffusion with Full State Supervision, replacing dense trajectory prediction with sparse, geometrically meaningful action anchors, i.e., keyposes such as pre-grasp pose, grasp pose directly anchored to affordances, drastically simplifying the prediction space; the action expert is forced to predict both robot joint angles and end-effector poses simultaneously, which exploits geometric consistency to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. Trained on large-scale, procedurally generated simulation data, AnchorDP3 achieves a 98.7% average success rate in the RoboTwin benchmark across diverse tasks under extreme randomization of objects, clutter, table height, lighting, and backgrounds. This framework, when integrated with the RoboTwin real-to-sim pipeline, has the potential to enable fully autonomous generation of deployable visuomotor policies from only scene and instruction, totally eliminating human demonstrations from learning manipulation skills.",

    "title": "When Life Gives You Samples: The Benefits of Scaling up Inference Compute for Multilingual LLMs",
    "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted focus toward scaling inference-time compute, improving performance without retraining the model. A common approach is to sample multiple outputs in parallel, and select one of these as the final output. However, work to date has focused on English and a handful of domains such as math and code. In contrast, we are most interested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally verifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly scale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual, multi-task setting.   Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation and selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and varied language settings. We evaluate existing selection methods, revealing that strategies effective in English often fail to generalize across languages. We propose novel sampling and selection strategies specifically adapted for multilingual and multi-task inference scenarios, and show they yield notable gains across languages and tasks. In particular, our combined sampling and selection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models on m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini. At larger scale, Command-A (111B model) equipped with our methods, shows +9.0 improvement in win-rates on the same benchmark with just five samples against single-sample decoding, a substantial increase at minimal cost. Our results underscore the need for language- and task-aware approaches to inference-time compute, aiming to democratize performance improvements in underrepresented languages.",

    "title": "OctoThinker: Mid-training Incentivizes Reinforcement Learning Scaling",
    "summary": "Different base language model families, such as Llama and Qwen, exhibit divergent behaviors during post-training with reinforcement learning (RL), especially on reasoning-intensive tasks. What makes a base language model suitable for reinforcement learning? Gaining deeper insight into this question is essential for developing RL-scalable foundation models of the next generation. In this work, we investigate how mid-training strategies shape RL dynamics, focusing on two representative model families: Qwen and Llama. Our study reveals that (1) high-quality mathematical corpora, such as MegaMath-Web-Pro, significantly improve both base model and RL performance, while existing alternatives (e.g., FineMath-4plus) fail to do so; (2) further adding QA-style data, particularly long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning examples, enhances RL outcomes, and instruction data further unlocks this effect; (3) while long-CoT improves reasoning depth, it can also induce verbosity of model responses and unstability of RL training, underscoring the importance of data formatting; (4) scaling mid-training consistently leads to stronger downstream RL performance. Building on these insights, we introduce a two-stage mid-training strategy, Stable-then-Decay, in which base models are first trained on 200B tokens with a constant learning rate, followed by 20B tokens across three CoT-focused branches with learning rate decay. This yields OctoThinker, a family of models demonstrating strong RL compatibility and closing the performance gap with more RL-friendly model families, i.e., Qwen. We hope our work will help shape pre-training strategies for foundation models in the RL era. To support further research, we release our open-source models along with a curated math reasoning-intensive corpus of over 70 billion tokens (i.e., MegaMath-Web-Pro-Max).",

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

    "summary": "Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for image synthesis, demonstrating exceptional photorealism and diversity. However, training diffusion models at high resolutions remains computationally prohibitive, and existing zero-shot generation techniques for synthesizing images beyond training resolutions often produce artifacts, including object duplication and spatial incoherence. In this paper, we introduce HiWave, a training-free, zero-shot approach that substantially enhances visual fidelity and structural coherence in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis using pretrained diffusion models. Our method employs a two-stage pipeline: generating a base image from the pretrained model followed by a patch-wise DDIM inversion step and a novel wavelet-based detail enhancer module. Specifically, we first utilize inversion methods to derive initial noise vectors that preserve global coherence from the base image. Subsequently, during sampling, our wavelet-domain detail enhancer retains low-frequency components from the base image to ensure structural consistency, while selectively guiding high-frequency components to enrich fine details and textures. Extensive evaluations using Stable Diffusion XL demonstrate that HiWave effectively mitigates common visual artifacts seen in prior methods, achieving superior perceptual quality. A user study confirmed HiWave's performance, where it was preferred over the state-of-the-art alternative in more than 80% of comparisons, highlighting its effectiveness for high-quality, ultra-high-resolution image synthesis without requiring retraining or architectural modifications.",

    "summary": "We introduce Biomed-Enriched, a biomedical text dataset constructed from PubMed via a two-stage annotation process. In the first stage, a large language model annotates 400K paragraphs from PubMed scientific articles, assigning scores for their type (review, study, clinical case, other), domain (clinical, biomedical, other), and educational quality. The educational quality score (rated 1 to 5) estimates how useful a paragraph is for college-level learning. These annotations are then used to fine-tune a small language model, which propagates the labels across the full PMC-OA corpus. The resulting metadata allows us to extract refined subsets, including 2M clinical case paragraphs with over 450K high-quality ones from articles with commercial-use licenses, and to construct several variants via quality filtering and domain upsampling. Clinical text is typically difficult to access due to privacy constraints, as hospital records cannot be publicly shared. Hence, our dataset provides an alternative large-scale, openly available collection of clinical cases from PubMed, making it a valuable resource for biomedical and clinical NLP. Preliminary continual-pretraining experiments with OLMo2 suggest these curated subsets enable targeted improvements, with clinical upsampling boosting performance by ~5% on MMLU ProfMed and educational quality filtering improving MedQA and MedMCQA by ~1%. Combinations of these techniques led to faster convergence, reaching same performance with a third of training tokens, indicating potential for more efficient and effective biomedical pretraining strategies.",

    "summary": "Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically degrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment. While channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized causes, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe Pre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier formation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key innovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while maintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing channel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection, redistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We validate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is the first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive 4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10 benchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2% training overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis (0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally altering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not inherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way for more efficient LLM deployment.

    "summary": "Accessibility remains a critical concern in today's society, as many technologies are not developed to support the full range of user needs. Existing multi-agent systems (MAS) often cannot provide comprehensive assistance for users in need due to the lack of customization stemming from closed-source designs. Consequently, individuals with disabilities frequently encounter significant barriers when attempting to interact with digital environments. We introduce MATE, a multimodal accessibility MAS, which performs the modality conversions based on the user's needs. The system is useful for assisting people with disabilities by ensuring that data will be converted to an understandable format. For instance, if the user cannot see well and receives an image, the system converts this image to its audio description. MATE can be applied to a wide range of domains, industries, and areas, such as healthcare, and can become a useful assistant for various groups of users. The system supports multiple types of models, ranging from LLM API calling to using custom machine learning (ML) classifiers. This flexibility ensures that the system can be adapted to various needs and is compatible with a wide variety of hardware. Since the system is expected to run locally, it ensures the privacy and security of sensitive information. In addition, the framework can be effectively integrated with institutional technologies (e.g., digital healthcare service) for real-time user assistance. Furthermore, we introduce ModCon-Task-Identifier, a model that is capable of extracting the precise modality conversion task from the user input. Numerous experiments show that ModCon-Task-Identifier consistently outperforms other LLMs and statistical models on our custom data.

In this work, we propose a novel framework that enhances image inversion using consistency models, enabling high-quality editing in just four steps.

    "title": "Is There a Case for Conversation Optimized Tokenizers in Large Language Models?",
    "summary": "The computational and energy costs of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased exponentially driven by the growing model sizes and the massive adoption of LLMs by hundreds of millions of users. The unit cost of an LLM is the computation of a token. Therefore, the tokenizer plays an important role in the efficiency of a model, and they are carefully optimized to minimize the number of tokens for the text in their training corpus. One of the most popular applications of LLMs are chatbots that interact with users. A key observation is that, for those chatbots, what is important is the performance of the tokenizer in the user text input and the chatbot responses. Those are most likely different from the text in the training corpus. So, a question that immediately arises is whether there is a potential benefit in optimizing tokenizers for chatbot conversations. In this paper, this idea is explored for different tokenizers by using a publicly available corpus of chatbot conversations to redesign their vocabularies and evaluate their performance in this domain. The results show that conversation-optimized tokenizers consistently reduce the number of tokens in chatbot dialogues, which can lead to meaningful energy savings, in the range of 5% to 10% while having minimal or even slightly positive impact on tokenization efficiency for the original training corpus.",

    "title": "Use Property-Based Testing to Bridge LLM Code Generation and Validation",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the \"cycle of self-deception\" where tests might share flaws with the code they are meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code. Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1 improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD methods.",

However, existing synthetic datasets remain insufficient for robust bimanual manipulation due to two challenges: (1) the lack of an efficient, scalable data generation method for novel tasks, and (2) oversimplified simulation environments that fail to capture real-world complexity. We present RoboTwin 2.0, a scalable simulation framework that enables automated, large-scale generation of diverse and realistic data, along with unified evaluation protocols for dual-arm manipulation. We first construct RoboTwin-OD, a large-scale object library comprising 731 instances across 147 categories, each annotated with semantic and manipulation-relevant labels. Building on this foundation, we develop an expert data synthesis pipeline that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with simulation-in-the-loop refinement to generate task-level execution code automatically. To improve sim-to-real transfer, RoboTwin 2.0 incorporates structured domain randomization along five axes: clutter, lighting, background, tabletop height and language instructions, thereby enhancing data diversity and policy robustness. We instantiate this framework across 50 dual-arm tasks spanning five robot embodiments, and pre-collect over 100,000 domain-randomized expert trajectories. Empirical results show a 10.9% gain in code generation success and improved generalization to novel real-world scenarios. A VLA model fine-tuned on our dataset achieves a 367% relative improvement (42.0% vs. 9.0%) on unseen scene real-world tasks, while zero-shot models trained solely on our synthetic data achieve a 228% relative gain, highlighting strong generalization without real-world supervision.
