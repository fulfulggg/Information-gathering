    "title": "Multimodal Approaches to Fair Image Classification: An Ethical Perspective",
    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12165v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence, machine perception is becoming paramount to achieving increased performance. Image classification systems are becoming increasingly integral to various applications, ranging from medical diagnostics to image generation; however, these systems often exhibit harmful biases that can lead to unfair and discriminatory outcomes. Machine Learning systems that depend on a single data modality, i.e. only images or only text, can exaggerate hidden biases present in the training data, if the data is not carefully balanced and filtered. Even so, these models can still harm underrepresented populations when used in improper contexts, such as when government agencies reinforce racial bias using predictive policing. This thesis explores the intersection of technology and ethics in the development of fair image classification models. Specifically, I focus on improving fairness and methods of using multiple modalities to combat harmful demographic bias. Integrating multimodal approaches, which combine visual data with additional modalities such as text and metadata, allows this work to enhance the fairness and accuracy of image classification systems. The study critically examines existing biases in image datasets and classification algorithms, proposes innovative methods for mitigating these biases, and evaluates the ethical implications of deploying such systems in real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experimentation and analysis, the thesis demonstrates how multimodal techniques can contribute to more equitable and ethical AI solutions, ultimately advocating for responsible AI practices that prioritize fairness.",

    "title": "Multi-Surrogate-Teacher Assistance for Representation Alignment in Fingerprint-based Indoor Localization",
    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12189v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite remarkable progress in knowledge transfer across visual and textual domains, extending these achievements to indoor localization, particularly for learning transferable representations among Received Signal Strength (RSS) fingerprint datasets, remains a challenge. This is due to inherent discrepancies among these RSS datasets, largely including variations in building structure, the input number and disposition of WiFi anchors. Accordingly, specialized networks, which were deprived of the ability to discern transferable representations, readily incorporate environment-sensitive clues into the learning process, hence limiting their potential when applied to specific RSS datasets. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play (PnP) framework of knowledge transfer, facilitating the exploitation of transferable representations for specialized networks directly on target RSS datasets through two main phases. Initially, we design an Expert Training phase, which features multiple surrogate generative teachers, all serving as a global adapter that homogenizes the input disparities among independent source RSS datasets while preserving their unique characteristics. In a subsequent Expert Distilling phase, we continue introducing a triplet of underlying constraints that requires minimizing the differences in essential knowledge between the specialized network and surrogate teachers through refining its representation learning on the target dataset. This process implicitly fosters a representational alignment in such a way that is less sensitive to specific environmental dynamics. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark WiFi RSS fingerprint datasets underscore the effectiveness of the framework that significantly exerts the full potential of specialized networks in localization.",

To address these health concerns, we present SitPose, a sitting posture and sedentary detection system utilizing the latest Kinect depth camera.

Existing approaches aim to learn modality-invariant representations in an unsupervised setting. However, these methods often encounter label noise within and across modalities due to suboptimal clustering results and considerable modality discrepancies, which impedes effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a straightforward yet effective solution for USL-VI-ReID by mitigating universal label noise using neighbor information.

To address this limitation, we propose a threefold approach to enhance the ability of T2V models to generate controllable cinematic language. Specifically, we introduce a cinematic language dataset that encompasses shot framing, angle, and camera movement, enabling models to learn diverse cinematic styles. Building on this, to facilitate robust cinematic alignment evaluation, we present CameraCLIP, a model fine-tuned on the proposed dataset that excels in understanding complex cinematic language in generated videos and can further provide valuable guidance in the multi-shot composition process. Finally, we propose CLIPLoRA, a cost-guided dynamic LoRA composition method that facilitates smooth transitions and realistic blending of cinematic language by dynamically fusing multiple pre-trained cinematic LoRAs within a single video. Our experiments demonstrate that CameraCLIP outperforms existing models in assessing the alignment between cinematic language and video, achieving an R@1 score of 0.81. Additionally, CLIPLoRA improves the ability for multi-shot composition, potentially bridging the gap between automatically generated videos and those shot by professional cinematographers.",

However, these model hubs lack advanced model management and identification mechanisms, resulting in users only searching for models through text matching, download sorting, etc., making it difficult to efficiently find the model that best meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel setting called Generative Model Identification (GMI), which aims to enable the user to identify the most appropriate generative model(s) for the user's requirements from a large number of candidate models efficiently. To our best knowledge, it has not been studied yet. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive solution consisting of three pivotal modules: a weighted Reduced Kernel Mean Embedding (RKME) framework for capturing the generated image distribution and the relationship between images and prompts, a pre-trained vision-language model aimed at addressing dimensionality challenges, and an image interrogator designed to tackle cross-modality issues. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the proposal is both efficient and effective. For example, users only need to submit a single example image to describe their requirements, and the model platform can achieve an average top-4 identification accuracy of more than 80%.",

However, existing methods are typically constrained to single-aspect concept generation or are easily disrupted by irrelevant concepts in multi-aspect concept scenarios, leading to concept confusion and hindering creative generation. To address this, we propose OmniPrism, a visual concept disentangling approach for creative image generation. Our method learns disentangled concept representations guided by natural language and trains a diffusion model to incorporate these concepts. We utilize the rich semantic space of a multimodal extractor to achieve concept disentanglement from given images and concept guidance. To disentangle concepts with different semantics, we construct a paired concept disentangled dataset (PCD-200K), where each pair shares the same concept such as content, style, and composition. We learn disentangled concept representations through our contrastive orthogonal disentangled (COD) training pipeline, which are then injected into additional diffusion cross-attention layers for generation. A set of block embeddings is designed to adapt each block's concept domain in the diffusion models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality, concept-disentangled results with high fidelity to text prompts and desired concepts.",

Given limited datasets encompassing both facial/background alterations and T2V/I2V content, we integrate task-irrelevant data alongside standard DeepFake datasets in training. We further mitigate the model's tendency to over-focus on faces by incorporating an attention-diversity (AD) loss, which promotes diverse spatial attention across video frames. Combining AD loss with cross-entropy improves detection performance across varied contexts.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12359v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced visual tasks by integrating visual representations into large language models (LLMs). The textual modality, inherited from LLMs, equips MLLMs with abilities like instruction following and in-context learning. In contrast, the visual modality enhances performance in downstream tasks by leveraging rich semantic content, spatial information, and grounding capabilities. These intrinsic modalities work synergistically across various visual tasks. Our research initially reveals a persistent imbalance between these modalities, with text often dominating output generation during visual instruction tuning. This imbalance occurs when using both full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. We then found that re-balancing these modalities can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters required, inspiring a direction for further optimizing visual instruction tuning. We introduce Modality Linear Representation-Steering (MoReS) to achieve the goal. MoReS effectively re-balances the intrinsic modalities throughout the model, where the key idea is to steer visual representations through linear transformations in the visual subspace across each model layer. To validate our solution, we composed LLaVA Steering, a suite of models integrated with the proposed MoReS method. Evaluation results show that the composed LLaVA Steering models require, on average, 500 times fewer trainable parameters than LoRA needs while still achieving comparable performance across three visual benchmarks and eight visual question-answering tasks. Last, we present the LLaVA Steering Factory, an in-house developed platform that enables researchers to quickly customize various MLLMs with component-based architecture for seamlessly integrating state-of-the-art models, and evaluate their intrinsic modality imbalance.",

To overcome this, we propose a differentiable surrogate loss that is computed on large batches, nearly equivalent to the entire training set. This computationally intensive process is made feasible through an implementation that bypasses the GPU memory limitations. Additionally, we introduce an efficient mixup regularization technique that operates on pairwise scalar similarities, effectively increasing the batch size even further.

However, these methods often struggle with the lack of accurate depth estimation caused by the natural weakness of the camera in ranging. Recently, multi-modal fusion and knowledge distillation methods for 3D object detection have been proposed to solve this problem, which are time-consuming during the training phase and not friendly to memory cost. In light of this, we propose PromptDet, a lightweight yet effective 3D object detection framework motivated by the success of prompt learning in 2D foundation model. Our proposed framework, PromptDet, comprises two integral components: a general camera-based detection module, exemplified by models like BEVDet and BEVDepth, and a LiDAR-assisted prompter. The LiDAR-assisted prompter leverages the LiDAR points as a complementary signal, enriched with a minimal set of additional trainable parameters. Notably, our framework is flexible due to our prompt-like design, which can not only be used as a lightweight multi-modal fusion method but also as a camera-only method for 3D object detection during the inference phase. Extensive experiments on nuScenes validate the effectiveness of the proposed PromptDet. As a multi-modal detector, PromptDet improves the mAP and NDS by at most 22.8\\% and 21.1\\% with fewer than 2\\% extra parameters compared with the camera-only baseline.

One could attempt to infer this underlying program, but current methods for doing so struggle with complex images and produce unorganized programs that make editing tedious. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to perform programmatic edits on pattern images. By using a pattern analogy -- a pair of simple patterns to demonstrate the intended edit -- and a learning-based generative model to execute these edits, our method allows users to intuitively edit patterns. To enable this paradigm, we introduce SplitWeave, a domain-specific language that, combined with a framework for sampling synthetic pattern analogies, enables the creation of a large, high-quality synthetic training dataset. We also present TriFuser, a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) designed to overcome critical issues that arise when naively deploying LDMs to this task.

Specifically, 1) a Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL) is designed to improve cross-modal semantic consistency by capturing intrinsic representations within each modality and semantic correlations across modalities. 2) To encourage the learning of multiple semantic correspondences, a Semantic Similarity-Supervision strategy (SSS) is proposed and injected into each contrastive learning process in DCL, supervising semantic similarity via the distribution-based uncertainty levels. Furthermore, a novel VLM-based SSMIS network is designed to compensate for the quality deficiencies of pseudo-labels. It utilizes the pretrained VLM to generate text prompt guided supervision information, refining the pseudo label for better consistency regularization. Experimental results demonstrate that our DuSSS achieves outstanding performance with Dice of 82.52%, 74.61% and 78.03% on three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, BM-Seg and MoNuSeg).",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12496v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vision Mamba (e.g., Vim) has successfully been integrated into computer vision, and token reduction has yielded promising outcomes in Vision Transformers (ViTs). However, token reduction performs less effectively on Vision Mamba compared to ViTs. Pruning informative tokens in Mamba leads to a high loss of key knowledge and bad performance. This makes it not a good solution for enhancing efficiency in Mamba. Token merging, which preserves more token information than pruning, has demonstrated commendable performance in ViTs. Nevertheless, vanilla merging performance decreases as the reduction ratio increases either, failing to maintain the key knowledge in Mamba. Re-training the token-reduced model enhances the performance of Mamba, by effectively rebuilding the key knowledge. Empirically, pruned Vims only drop up to 0.9% accuracy on ImageNet-1K, recovered by our proposed framework R-MeeTo in our main evaluation. We show how simple and effective the fast recovery can be achieved at minute-level, in particular, a 35.9% accuracy spike over 3 epochs of training on Vim-Ti. Moreover, Vim-Ti/S/B are re-trained within 5/7/17 minutes, and Vim-S only drop 1.3% with 1.2x (up to 1.5x) speed up in inference.",

Although current approaches have achieved promising performance, the edge information is insufficiently exploited, resulting in poor integrality and high false alarms. To tackle this problem, we propose a multi-scale cross-fusion and edge-supervision network for ISL. Specifically, our framework consists of three key steps: multi-scale features cross-fusion, edge mask prediction and edge-supervision localization. Firstly, we input the RGB image and its noise image into a segmentation network to learn multi-scale features, which are then aggregated via a cross-scale fusion followed by a cross-domain fusion to enhance feature representation. Secondly, we design an edge mask prediction module to effectively mine the reliable boundary artifacts. Finally, the cross-fused features and the reliable edge mask information are seamlessly integrated via an attention mechanism to incrementally supervise and facilitate model training.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12511v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As Generative AI continues to become more accessible, the case for robust detection of generated images in order to combat misinformation is stronger than ever. Invisible watermarking methods act as identifiers of generated content, embedding image- and latent-space messages that are robust to many forms of perturbations. The majority of current research investigates full-image attacks against images with a single watermarking method applied. We introduce novel improvements to watermarking robustness as well as minimizing degradation on image quality during attack. Firstly, we examine the application of both image-space and latent-space watermarking methods on a single image, where we propose a custom watermark remover network which preserves one of the watermarking modalities while completely removing the other during decoding. Then, we investigate localized blurring attacks (LBA) on watermarked images based on the GradCAM heatmap acquired from the watermark decoder in order to reduce the amount of degradation to the target image. Our evaluation suggests that 1) implementing the watermark remover model to preserve one of the watermark modalities when decoding the other modality slightly improves on the baseline performance, and that 2) LBA degrades the image significantly less compared to uniform blurring of the entire image.

To address these issues, we propose CREST, a novel conjointly-trained spike-driven framework to exploit spatiotemporal dynamics in event-based object detection. We introduce the conjoint learning rule to accelerate SNN learning and alleviate gradient vanishing. It also supports dual operation modes for efficient and flexible implementation on different hardware types.

To address these limitations, this study explores the use of generative models, such as Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Progressive Growing Generative Adversarial Networks (PGGANs), for dataset augmentation. The research introduces a framework to assess the impact of synthetic images generated by DDPM and PGGANs on the performance of four models: a custom CNN, Untrained VGG16, Pretrained VGG16, and Pretrained ResNet50. Experiments were conducted using Random Sampling and Greedy K Sampling to create small, imbalanced datasets. The synthetic images were evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and compared to original datasets through classification metrics. The results show that DDPM consistently generated more realistic images with lower FID scores and significantly outperformed PGGANs in improving classification metrics across all models and datasets. Incorporating DDPM-generated images into the original datasets increased accuracy by up to 6%, enhancing model robustness and stability, particularly in imbalanced scenarios. Random Sampling demonstrated superior stability, while Greedy K Sampling offered diversity at the cost of higher FID scores.

However, automating LULC map generation using machine learning is rendered challenging due to noisy labels. Typically, the ground truths (e.g. ESRI LULC, MapBioMass) have noisy labels that hamper the model's ability to learn to accurately classify the pixels. Further, these erroneous labels can significantly distort the performance metrics of a model, leading to misleading evaluations. Traditionally, the ambiguous labels are rectified using unsupervised algorithms. These algorithms struggle not only with scalability but also with generalization across different geographies. To overcome these challenges, we propose a zero-shot approach using the foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to automatically delineate different land parcels/regions and leverage them to relabel the unsure pixels by using the local label statistics within each detected region. We achieve a significant reduction in label noise and an improvement in the performance of the downstream segmentation model by $\\approx 5\\%$ when trained with denoised labels.",

To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps.

Recently, from the perspective of over-parameterization, a series of methods leveraging weight sparsification techniques have shown promising performance. These methods typically focus on selecting important parameters for in-distribution (ID) data to reduce the negative impact of redundant parameters on OOD detection. However, we empirically find that these selected parameters may behave overconfidently toward OOD data and hurt OOD detection. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method called Instance-aware Test Pruning (ITP), which performs OOD detection by considering both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels of parameter pruning. Specifically, ITP first estimates the class-specific parameter contribution distribution by exploring the ID data. By using the contribution distribution, ITP conducts coarse-grained pruning to eliminate redundant parameters. More importantly, ITP further adopts a fine-grained test pruning process based on the right-tailed Z-score test, which can adaptively remove instance-level overconfident parameters. Finally, ITP derives OOD scores from the pruned model to achieve more reliable predictions. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmarks verify the effectiveness of ITP, demonstrating its competitive performance.",

Recently, a number of works further explored how to employ the power of large diffusion models as zero-shot classifiers. While recent zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers have made performance advancement on benchmark datasets, they still suffered badly from extremely slow classification speed (e.g., ~1000 seconds per classifying single image on ImageNet). The extremely slow classification speed strongly prohibits existing zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers from practical applications. In this paper, we propose an embarrassingly simple and efficient zero-shot Gaussian Diffusion Classifiers (GDC) via pretrained text-to-image diffusion models and DINOv2. The proposed GDC can not only significantly surpass previous zero-shot diffusion-based classifiers by over 10 points (61.40% - 71.44%) on ImageNet, but also accelerate more than 30000 times (1000 - 0.03 seconds) classifying a single image on ImageNet. Additionally, it provides probability interpretation of the results.

Our findings reveal that distributing attention equally across normal and pseudo-anomalous data tends to dilute the model's focus on anomalous deviations. The challenge is further compounded by the inherently disordered and sparse nature of 3D point cloud data. In response to those predicaments, we introduce an innovative approach that emphasizes learning point offsets, targeting more informative pseudo-abnormal points, thus fostering more effective distillation of normal data representations. We also have crafted an augmentation technique that is steered by normal vectors, facilitating the creation of credible pseudo anomalies that enhance the efficiency of the training process.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12620v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Detecting small targets in sea clutter is challenging due to dynamic maritime conditions. Existing solutions either model sea clutter for detection or extract target features based on clutter-target echo differences, including statistical and deep features. While more common, the latter often excels in controlled scenarios but struggles with robust detection and generalization in diverse environments, limiting practical use. In this letter, we propose a multi-domain features guided supervised contrastive learning (MDFG_SCL) method, which integrates statistical features derived from multi-domain differences with deep features obtained through supervised contrastive learning, thereby capturing both low-level domain-specific variations and high-level semantic information. This comprehensive feature integration enables the model to effectively distinguish between small targets and sea clutter, even under challenging conditions. Experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed shallow-to-deep detector not only achieves effective identification of small maritime targets but also maintains superior detection performance across varying sea conditions, outperforming the mainstream unsupervised contrastive learning and supervised contrastive learning methods.",

    "title": "Improving the Transferability of 3D Point Cloud Attack via Spectral-aware Admix and Optimization Designs",
    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12626v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep learning models for point clouds have shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which have received increasing attention in various safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance. Existing 3D attackers generally design various attack strategies in the white-box setting, requiring the prior knowledge of 3D model details. However, real-world 3D applications are in the black-box setting, where we can only acquire the outputs of the target classifier. Although few recent works try to explore the black-box attack, they still achieve limited attack success rates (ASR). To alleviate this issue, this paper focuses on attacking the 3D models in a transfer-based black-box setting, where we first carefully design adversarial examples in a white-box surrogate model and then transfer them to attack other black-box victim models. Specifically, we propose a novel Spectral-aware Admix with Augmented Optimization method (SAAO) to improve the adversarial transferability. In particular, since traditional Admix strategy are deployed in the 2D domain that adds pixel-wise images for perturbing, we can not directly follow it to merge point clouds in coordinate domain as it will destroy the geometric shapes. Therefore, we design spectral-aware fusion that performs Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to get spectral features of the point clouds and add them in the spectral domain. Afterward, we run a few steps with spectral-aware weighted Admix to select better optimization paths as well as to adjust corresponding learning weights. At last, we run more steps to generate adversarial spectral feature along the optimization path and perform Inverse-GFT on the adversarial spectral feature to obtain the adversarial example in the data domain. Experiments show that our SAAO achieves better transferability compared to existing 3D attack methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12628v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the field of audio-visual learning, most research tasks focus exclusively on short videos. This paper focuses on the more practical Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task, advancing audio-visual scene understanding for longer, {untrimmed} videos. This task seeks to identify and temporally pinpoint all events simultaneously occurring in both audio and visual streams. Typically, each video encompasses dense events of multiple classes, which may overlap on the timeline, each exhibiting varied durations. Given these challenges, effectively exploiting the audio-visual relations and the temporal features encoded at various granularities becomes crucial. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel \\ul{CC}Net, comprising two core modules: the Cross-Modal Consistency \\ul{C}ollaboration (CMCC) and the Multi-Temporal Granularity \\ul{C}ollaboration (MTGC). Specifically, the CMCC module contains two branches: a cross-modal interaction branch and a temporal consistency-gated branch. The former branch facilitates the aggregation of consistent event semantics across modalities through the encoding of audio-visual relations, while the latter branch guides one modality's focus to pivotal event-relevant temporal areas as discerned in the other modality. The MTGC module includes a coarse-to-fine collaboration block and a fine-to-coarse collaboration block, providing bidirectional support among coarse- and fine-grained temporal features. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 dataset validate our module design, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance in dense audio-visual event localization.

Due to data scarcity, existing FSCIL methods resort to training a backbone with abundant base data and then keeping it frozen afterward. However, the above operation often causes the backbone to overfit to base classes while overlooking the novel ones, leading to severe confusion between them. To address this issue, we propose Class-Aware Logit Adapter (CALA). Our method involves a lightweight adapter that learns to rectify biased predictions through a pseudo-incremental learning paradigm. In the real FSCIL process, we use the learned adapter to dynamically generate robust balancing factors. These factors can adjust confused novel instances back to their true label space based on their similarity to base classes. Specifically, when confusion is more likely to occur in novel instances that closely resemble base classes, greater rectification is required. Notably, CALA operates on the classifier level, preserving the original feature space, thus it can be flexibly plugged into most of the existing FSCIL works for improved performance. Experiments on three benchmark datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and flexibility of CALA. Codes will be available upon acceptance.",

SAM has shown promising binary segmentation performance in natural domains, however, transferring it to the medical domain remains challenging, as medical images often possess substantial inter-category overlaps. To address this, we propose the SEmantic-Guided SAM (SEG-SAM), a unified medical segmentation model that incorporates semantic medical knowledge to enhance medical segmentation performance. First, to avoid the potential conflict between binary and semantic predictions, we introduce a semantic-aware decoder independent of SAM's original decoder, specialized for both semantic segmentation on the prompted object and classification on unprompted objects in images. To further enhance the model's semantic understanding, we solicit key characteristics of medical categories from large language models and incorporate them into SEG-SAM through a text-to-vision semantic module, adaptively transferring the language information into the visual segmentation task. In the end, we introduce the cross-mask spatial alignment strategy to encourage greater overlap between the predicted masks from SEG-SAM's two decoders, thereby benefiting both predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEG-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art SAM-based methods in unified binary medical segmentation and task-specific methods in semantic medical segmentation, showcasing promising results and potential for broader medical applications.",

Our methodology combines visual patch selection with embedding similarity-based refinement. The first stage focuses on selecting patches from 360-degree images using three distinct sampling methods to ensure comprehensive coverage of visual content for IQA. The second stage, which is the core of our approach, employs an embedding similarity-based selection process to filter and prioritize the most informative patches based on their embeddings similarity distances. This dual selection mechanism ensures that the training data is both relevant and informative, enhancing the model's learning efficiency. Extensive experiments and statistical analyses using three distance metrics across three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our selection algorithm. The results highlight its potential to deliver robust and accurate 360-degree IQA, with performance gains of up to 4.5% in accuracy and monotonicity of quality score prediction, while using only 40% to 50% of the training patches.

Existing methods alleviate catastrophic forgetting by replaying distributions of previously learned classes using stored prototypes or features. However, they overlook a critical issue: in CISS, the representation of class knowledge is updated continuously through incremental learning, whereas prototype replay methods maintain fixed prototypes. This mismatch between updated representation and fixed prototypes limits the effectiveness of the prototype replay strategy. To address this issue, we propose the Adaptive prototype replay (Adapter) for CISS in this paper. Adapter comprises an adaptive deviation compen sation (ADC) strategy and an uncertainty-aware constraint (UAC) loss. Specifically, the ADC strategy dynamically updates the stored prototypes based on the estimated representation shift distance to match the updated representation of old class. The UAC loss reduces prediction uncertainty, aggregating discriminative features to aid in generating compact prototypes. Additionally, we introduce a compensation-based prototype similarity discriminative (CPD) loss to ensure adequate differentiation between similar prototypes, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the adaptive prototype replay strategy. Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that Adapter achieves state-of-the-art results and proves effective across various CISS tasks, particularly in challenging multi-step scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12672v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, semantic segmentation has flourished in various applications. However, the high computational cost remains a significant challenge that hinders its further adoption. The filter pruning method for structured network slimming offers a direct and effective solution for the reduction of segmentation networks. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing pruning methods, originally designed for image classification, overlook the fact that segmentation is a location-sensitive task, which consequently leads to their suboptimal performance when applied to segmentation networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach, denoted as Spatial-aware Information Redundancy Filter Pruning~(SIRFP), which aims to reduce feature redundancy between channels. First, we formulate the pruning process as a maximum edge weight clique problem~(MEWCP) in graph theory, thereby minimizing the redundancy among the remaining features after pruning. Within this framework, we introduce a spatial-aware redundancy metric based on feature maps, thus endowing the pruning process with location sensitivity to better adapt to pruning segmentation networks. Additionally, based on the MEWCP, we propose a low computational complexity greedy strategy to solve this NP-hard problem, making it feasible and efficient for structured pruning. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive comparative experiments on various challenging datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of SIRFP for semantic segmentation tasks.",

In this work, we propose a novel task, BestShot, which aims to locate highlight frames within human-centric videos via language queries. This task demands not only a deep semantic comprehension of human actions but also precise temporal localization. To support this task, we introduce the BestShot Benchmark. %The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human detection and tracking, potential frame selection based on human judgment, and detailed textual descriptions crafted by human input to ensure precision. The benchmark is meticulously constructed by combining human-annotated highlight frames, detailed textual descriptions and duration labeling. These descriptions encompass three critical elements: (1) Visual content; (2) Fine-grained action; and (3) Human Pose Description. Together, these elements provide the necessary precision to identify the exact highlight frames in videos.\n  To tackle this problem, we have collected two distinct datasets: (i) ShotGPT4o Dataset, which is algorithmically generated by GPT-4o and (ii) Image-SMPLText Dataset, a dataset with large-scale and accurate per-frame pose description leveraging PoseScript and existing pose estimation datasets. Based on these datasets, we present a strong baseline model, ShotVL, fine-tuned from InternVL, specifically for BestShot. We highlight the impressive zero-shot capabilities of our model and offer comparative analyses with existing SOTA models.

Despite attempts to integrate them into a unified network, the constraints between the two heterogeneous tasks are not explicitly modeled, since the pioneering studies either utilize a loosely coupled parallel structure or engage in only implicit interactions, failing to capture the inherent connections. In this work, we explore the connections between the two tasks and propose a new network that imposes semantic constraints on the stereo matching task, both implicitly and explicitly. Implicitly, we transform the traditional parallel structure to a new cascade structure termed Semantic-Guided Cascade structure, where the deep features enriched with semantic information are utilized for the computation of initial disparity maps, enhancing semantic guidance. Explicitly, we propose a Semantic Selective Refinement (SSR) module and a Left-Right Semantic Consistency (LRSC) module. The SSR refines the initial disparity map under the guidance of the semantic map. The LRSC ensures semantic consistency between two views via reducing the semantic divergence after transforming the semantic map from one view to the other using the disparity map.

Existing defense methods show that such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially cropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as corrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial images and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean images after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images for voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the original images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS (Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model is prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a partial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial image understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its original response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can supervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model becomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's partial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean input, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments show our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success rate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models.",

The Radar-Camera fusion in outdoor 3D scene perception is capped by the image-to-BEV transformation--if the depth of pixels is not accurately estimated, the naive combination of BEV features actually integrates unaligned visual content. To avoid this problem, we propose a query-based framework that enables adaptively sample instance-relevant features from both the BEV and the original image view. Furthermore, we enhance system performance by two key designs: optimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity of BEV. For the former, we introduce an adaptive circular distribution in polar coordinates to refine the initialization of object queries, allowing for a distance-based adjustment of query density. For the latter, we initially incorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image view to BEV. Subsequently, we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar and introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements within the BEV. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets validate the merits of our design.

In this work we highlight the similarity between 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) and billboards from traditional computer graphics. Both use flat semi-transparent 2D geometry that is positioned, oriented and scaled in 3D space. However 2DGS uses a solid color per splat and an opacity modulated by a Gaussian distribution, where billboards are more expressive, modulating the color with a uv-parameterized texture. We propose to unify these concepts by presenting Gaussian Billboards, a modification of 2DGS to add spatially-varying color achieved using per-splat texture interpolation. The result is a mixture of the two representations, which benefits from both the robust scene optimization power of 2DGS and the expressiveness of texture mapping. We show that our method can improve the sharpness and quality of the scene representation in a wide range of qualitative and quantitative evaluations compared to the original 2DGS implementation.",

Moreover, existing open-source VLMs lack systematic exploration into extending their context length, and commercial models often provide limited details. To tackle this, we aim to establish an effective solution that enhances long context performance of VLMs while preserving their capacities in short context scenarios. Towards this goal, we make the best design choice through extensive experiment settings from data curation to context window extending and utilizing: (1) we analyze data sources and length distributions to construct ETVLM - a data recipe to balance the performance across scenarios; (2) we examine existing position extending methods, identify their limitations and propose M-RoPE++ as an enhanced approach; we also choose to solely instruction-tune the backbone with mixed-source data; (3) we discuss how to better utilize extended context windows and propose hybrid-resolution training. Built on the Qwen-VL series model, we propose Giraffe, which is effectively extended to 128K lengths. Evaluated on extensive long context VLM benchmarks such as VideoMME and Viusal Haystacks, our Giraffe achieves state-of-the-art performance among similarly sized open-source long VLMs and is competitive with commercial model GPT-4V.

Existing data representations, such as complex-valued data, polarimetric features, and amplitude images, are widely used. However, these formats often face issues related to usability, interpretability, and data integrity. Most feature extraction networks for PolSAR are small, limiting their ability to capture features effectively. To address these issues, We propose the Polarimetric Scattering Mechanism-Informed SAM (PolSAM), an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) that integrates domain-specific scattering characteristics and a novel prompt generation strategy. PolSAM introduces Microwave Vision Data (MVD), a lightweight and interpretable data representation derived from polarimetric decomposition and semantic correlations. We propose two key components: the Feature-Level Fusion Prompt (FFP), which fuses visual tokens from pseudo-colored SAR images and MVD to address modality incompatibility in the frozen SAM encoder, and the Semantic-Level Fusion Prompt (SFP), which refines sparse and dense segmentation prompts using semantic information. Experimental results on the PhySAR-Seg datasets demonstrate that PolSAM significantly outperforms existing SAM-based and multimodal fusion models, improving segmentation accuracy, reducing data storage, and accelerating inference time.

Additionally, autonomous systems deployed in unconstrained real-world scenarios must be able of dealing with novel situations and object that have never been seen before. In this article, we tackle the problem of open-world panoptic segmentation, i.e., the task of discovering new semantic categories and new object instances at test time, while enforcing consistency among the categories that we incrementally discover.

However, when editing 3D scenes, existing works mostly rely on training a NeRF for 3D editing. Recent NeRF editing methods leverages edit operations by deploying 2D diffusion models and project these edits into 3D space. They require strong positional priors alongside text prompt to identify the edit location. These methods are operational on small 3D scenes and are more generalized to particular scene. They require training for each specific edit and cannot be exploited in real-time edits. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method, FreeEdit, to make edits in training free manner using mesh representations as a substitute for NeRF. Training-free methods are now a possibility because of the advances in foundation model's space. We leverage these models to bring a training-free alternative and introduce solutions for insertion, replacement and deletion. We consider insertion, replacement and deletion as basic blocks for performing intricate edits with certain combinations of these operations. Given a text prompt and a 3D scene, our model is capable of identifying what object should be inserted/replaced or deleted and location where edit should be performed. We also introduce a novel algorithm as part of FreeEdit to find the optimal location on grounding object for placement. We evaluate our model by comparing it with baseline models on a wide range of scenes using quantitative and qualitative metrics and showcase the merits of our method with respect to others.",

A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit obvious artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden.

These artifacts degrade novel view quality, especially in areas unseen by the training cameras. We present a fast, post-hoc NeRF cleanup method that eliminates such artifacts by enforcing our Free Space Prior, effectively minimizing floaters without disrupting the NeRF's representation of observed regions. Unlike existing approaches that rely on either Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation to fit the data or a complex, local data-driven prior, our method adopts a Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) approach, selecting the optimal model parameters under a simple global prior assumption that unseen regions should remain empty. This enables our method to clean artifacts in both seen and unseen areas, enhancing novel view quality even in challenging scene regions. Our method is comparable with existing NeRF cleanup models while being 2.5x faster in inference time, requires no additional memory beyond the original NeRF, and achieves cleanup training in less than 30 seconds.

Generating corresponding FFA images from non-invasive fundus images holds significant practical value but also presents challenges. First, limited datasets constrain the performance and effectiveness of models. Second, previous studies have primarily focused on generating FFA for single diseases or single modalities, often resulting in poor performance for patients with various ophthalmic conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel latent diffusion model-based framework, Diffusion, which introduces a fine-tuning protocol to overcome the challenge of limited medical data and unleash the generative capabilities of diffusion models. Furthermore, we designed a new approach to tackle the challenges of generating across different modalities and disease types.

Existing approaches typically develop independent hierarchy-aware models based on shared features extracted from a common base encoder. However, because coarse-grained levels are inherently easier to learn than finer ones, the base encoder tends to prioritize coarse feature abstractions, which impedes the learning of fine-grained features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel framework called the Bidirectional Logits Tree (BiLT) for Granularity Reconcilement. The key idea is to develop classifiers sequentially from the finest to the coarsest granularities, rather than parallelly constructing a set of classifiers based on the same input features. In this setup, the outputs of finer-grained classifiers serve as inputs for coarser-grained ones, facilitating the flow of hierarchical semantic information across different granularities. On top of this, we further introduce an Adaptive Intra-Granularity Difference Learning (AIGDL) approach to uncover subtle semantic differences between classes within the same granularity.

In this paper, we address the challenges of SGG by framing it as multi-label classification problem with partial annotation, where relevant labels of fine-grained predicates are missing. Under the new frame, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Scene Graph Generation (RA-SGG), which identifies potential instances to be multi-labeled and enriches the single-label with multi-labels that are semantically similar to the original label by retrieving relevant samples from our established memory bank. Based on augmented relations (i.e., discovered multi-labels), we apply multi-prototype learning to train our SGG model. Several comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that RA-SGG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 3.6% on VG and 5.9% on GQA, particularly in terms of F@K, showing that RA-SGG effectively alleviates the issue of biased prediction caused by the long-tailed distribution and semantic ambiguity of predicates.",

This setting poses a great challenge in accurately locating the temporal location of event, as the relevant supervision is unavailable. Existing methods rely on explicit alignment constraints between event locations and captions, which involve complex event proposal procedures during both training and inference. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel implicit location-caption alignment paradigm by complementary masking, which simplifies the complex event proposal and localization process while maintaining effectiveness. Specifically, our model comprises two components: a dual-mode video captioning module and a mask generation module. The dual-mode video captioning module captures global event information and generates descriptive captions, while the mask generation module generates differentiable positive and negative masks for localizing the events. These masks enable the implicit alignment of event locations and captions by ensuring that captions generated from positively and negatively masked videos are complementary, thereby forming a complete video description. In this way, even under weak supervision, the event location and event caption can be aligned implicitly. Extensive experiments on the public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods and achieves competitive results compared to fully-supervised methods.",

CLIP, a large-scale vision-language model, performs well in FSL on image-text embedding similarities, but it is susceptible to misclassification caused by noisy labels. How to enhance domain generalization of CLIP on noisy data within FSL tasks is a critical challenge. In this paper, we provide a novel view to mitigate the influence of noisy labels, CLIP-based Robust Few-shot learning (CRoF). CRoF is a general plug-in module for CLIP-based models. To avoid misclassification and confused label embedding, we design the few-shot task-oriented prompt generator to give more discriminative descriptions of each category. The proposed prompt achieves larger distances of inter-class textual embedding. Furthermore, rather than fully trusting zero-shot classification by CLIP, we fine-tune CLIP on noisy few-shot data in a new domain with a weighting strategy like label-smooth. The weights for multiple potentially correct labels consider the relationship between CLIP's prior knowledge and original label information to ensure reliability. Our multiple label loss function further supports robust training under this paradigm.

To alleviate the effect of elevation ambiguity in radar point clouds, we gradually locate the position of the object via a sequential fusion structure. It helps to get more precise and flexible correspondences between tokens and queries. A pruning training strategy is adopted in the decoder, which can save much time during inference and inhibit queries from losing their distinctiveness.

However, traditional multi-view learning approaches are tailored for scenarios with fixed data views, falling short of emulating the intricate cognitive procedures of the human brain processing signals sequentially. Our cerebral architecture seamlessly integrates sequential data through intricate feed-forward and feedback mechanisms. In stark contrast, traditional methods struggle to generalize effectively when confronted with data spanning diverse domains, highlighting the need for innovative strategies that can mimic the brain's adaptability and dynamic integration capabilities. In this paper, we propose a bio-neurologically inspired multi-view incremental framework named MVIL aimed at emulating the brain's fine-grained fusion of sequentially arriving views. MVIL lies two fundamental modules: structured Hebbian plasticity and synaptic partition learning. The structured Hebbian plasticity reshapes the structure of weights to express the high correlation between view representations, facilitating a fine-grained fusion of view representations. Moreover, synaptic partition learning is efficient in alleviating drastic changes in weights and also retaining old knowledge by inhibiting partial synapses. These modules bionically play a central role in reinforcing crucial associations between newly acquired information and existing knowledge repositories, thereby enhancing the network's capacity for generalization.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12827v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Extraction of transaction information from bank statements is required to assess one's financial well-being for credit rating and underwriting decisions. Unlike other financial documents such as tax forms or financial statements, extracting the transaction descriptions from bank statements can provide a comprehensive and recent view into the cash flows and spending patterns. With multiple variations in layout and templates across several banks, extracting transactional level information from different table categories is an arduous task. Existing table structure recognition approaches produce sub optimal results for long, complex tables and are unable to capture all transactions accurately. This paper proposes TabSniper, a novel approach for efficient table detection, categorization and structure recognition from bank statements. The pipeline starts with detecting and categorizing tables of interest from the bank statements. The extracted table regions are then processed by the table structure recognition model followed by a post-processing module to transform the transactional data into a structured and standardised format. The detection and structure recognition architectures are based on DETR, fine-tuned with diverse bank statements along with additional feature enhancements. Results on challenging datasets demonstrate that TabSniper outperforms strong baselines and produces high-quality extraction of transaction information from bank and other financial documents across multiple layouts and templates.",

Unlike the case of videos depicting all the same activity, the temporal order of actions is not roughly shared among all videos, making the task even more challenging. We propose to use activity labels to learn, in a weakly-supervised fashion, action representations suitable for global action segmentation. For this purpose, we introduce a triadic learning approach for video pairs, to ensure intra-video action discrimination, as well as inter-video and inter-activity action association. For the backbone architecture, we use a Siamese network based on sparse transformers that takes as input video pairs and determine whether they belong to the same activity. The proposed approach is validated on two challenging benchmark datasets: Breakfast and YouTube Instructions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.",

Additionally, an uncertainty-based foreground-oriented image alignment module (UFOA) is proposed to explicitly guide the model to focus more on regions of interest.

However, visual information lacking of guidance from the user's intention may lead to redundant computation and involve unnecessary visual noise, especially in long, untrimmed videos. To address this issue, we propose FocusChat, a text-guided multi-modal large language model (LLM) that emphasizes visual information correlated to the user's prompt. In detail, Our model first undergoes the semantic extraction module, which comprises a visual semantic branch and a text semantic branch to extract image and text semantics, respectively. The two branches are combined using the Spatial-Temporal Filtering Module (STFM). STFM enables explicit spatial-level information filtering and implicit temporal-level feature filtering, ensuring that the visual tokens are closely aligned with the user's query. It lowers the essential number of visual tokens inputted into the LLM. FocusChat significantly outperforms Video-LLaMA in zero-shot experiments, using an order of magnitude less training data with only 16 visual tokens occupied. It achieves results comparable to the state-of-the-art in few-shot experiments, with only 0.72M pre-training data.",

Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at least 7.30% and 3.30% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 5.48x lower energy consumption and 1.14x faster inference speed.",

However, due to the powerful modeling and generalization ability of neural networks, some anomalies can also be well reconstructed, resulting in unsatisfactory detection and localization accuracy. In this paper, a small coarsely-labeled anomaly dataset is first collected. Then, a coarse-knowledge-aware adversarial learning method is developed to align the distribution of reconstructed features with that of normal features. The alignment can effectively suppress the auto-encoder's reconstruction ability on anomalies and thus improve the detection accuracy. Considering that anomalies often only occupy very small areas in anomalous images, a patch-level adversarial learning strategy is further developed. Although no patch-level anomalous information is available, we rigorously prove that by simply viewing any patch features from anomalous images as anomalies, the proposed knowledge-aware method can also align the distribution of reconstructed patch features with the normal ones. Experimental results on four medical datasets and two industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving the detection and localization performance.",

Reconstructing accurate 3D hand meshes from monocular videos is a crucial task for understanding human behaviour, with significant applications in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR). However, existing methods for monocular hand reconstruction typically rely on a weak perspective camera model, which simulates hand motion within a limited camera frustum. As a result, these approaches struggle to recover the full 3D global trajectory and often produce noisy or incorrect depth estimations, particularly when the video is captured by dynamic or moving cameras, which is common in egocentric scenarios. Our Dyn-HaMR consists of a multi-stage, multi-objective optimization pipeline, that factors in (i) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) to robustly estimate relative camera motion, (ii) an interacting-hand prior for generative infilling and to refine the interaction dynamics, ensuring plausible recovery under (self-)occlusions, and (iii) hierarchical initialization through a combination of state-of-the-art hand tracking methods. Through extensive evaluations on both in-the-wild and indoor datasets, we show that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of 4D global mesh recovery.

However, recent zero-shot video editing techniques primarily focus on global or single-object edits, which can lead to unintended changes in other parts of the video. When multiple objects require localized edits, existing methods face challenges, such as unfaithful editing, editing leakage, and lack of suitable evaluation datasets and metrics.

Additionally, we present our new MIVE Dataset featuring diverse video scenarios and introduce the Cross-Instance Accuracy (CIA) Score to evaluate editing leakage in multi-instance video editing tasks. Our extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study evaluations demonstrate that MIVE significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of editing faithfulness, accuracy, and leakage prevention, setting a new benchmark for multi-instance video editing.

This process is either achieved in a structured or unstructured manner. While structured pruning allows reaching high efficiency, unstructured one is more flexible and leads to better accuracy, but this is achieved at the expense of low computational performance. In this paper, we devise a novel coarse-to-fine (CTF) method that gathers the advantages of structured and unstructured pruning while discarding their inconveniences to some extent. Our method relies on a novel CTF parametrization that models the mask of each connection as the Hadamard product involving four parametrizations which capture channel-wise, column-wise, row-wise and entry-wise pruning respectively. Hence, fine-grained pruning is enabled only when the coarse-grained one is disabled, and this leads to highly efficient networks while being effective. Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging task of skeleton-based recognition, using the standard SBU and FPHA datasets, show the clear advantage of our CTF approach against different baselines as well as the related work.",

The recent studies of model interaction and self-corrective reasoning approach in large language models offer new insights for enhancing text-to-image models. Inspired by these studies, we propose a novel method called ArtAug for enhancing text-to-image models in this paper. To the best of our knowledge, ArtAug is the first one that improves image synthesis models via model interactions with understanding models. In the interactions, we leverage human preferences implicitly learned by image understanding models to provide fine-grained suggestions for image synthesis models. The interactions can modify the image content to make it aesthetically pleasing, such as adjusting exposure, changing shooting angles, and adding atmospheric effects. The enhancements brought by the interaction are iteratively fused into the synthesis model itself through an additional enhancement module. This enables the synthesis model to directly produce aesthetically pleasing images without any extra computational cost. In the experiments, we train the ArtAug enhancement module on existing text-to-image models. Various evaluation metrics consistently demonstrate that ArtAug enhances the generative capabilities of text-to-image models without incurring additional computational costs.

Allowing these uncertainties to participate in training hinders the improvement of gaze estimation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose an effective solution, named Suppressing Uncertainty in Gaze Estimation (SUGE), which introduces a novel triplet-label consistency measurement to estimate and reduce the uncertainties. Specifically, for each training sample, we propose to estimate a novel ``neighboring label'' calculated by a linearly weighted projection from the neighbors to capture the similarity relationship between image features and their corresponding labels, which can be incorporated with the predicted pseudo label and ground-truth label for uncertainty estimation. By modeling such triplet-label consistency, we can measure the qualities of both images and labels, and further largely reduce the negative effects of unqualified images and wrong labels through our designed sample weighting and label correction strategies. Experimental results on the gaze estimation benchmarks indicate that our proposed SUGE achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.",

One solution to this scarcity is the generation of synthetic high-quality anomalous samples. While numerous methods exist for this task, most require highly trained individuals for setup.\n  This work addresses the challenge of generating synthetic anomalies in an automatic fashion that requires only an initial collection of normal and anomalous samples from the user - a task that is straightforward for farmers. We demonstrate the approach in the context of table grape cultivation. Specifically, based on the observation that normal berries present relatively smooth surfaces, while defects result in more complex textures, we introduce a Dual-Canny Edge Detection (DCED) filter. This filter emphasizes the additional texture indicative of diseases, pest infestations, or other defects. Using segmentation masks provided by the Segment Anything Model, we then select and seamlessly blend anomalous berries onto normal ones.

Firstly, in light of the observation that the self-attention maps influence the structure and shape details of the generated images, we propose Attention Activation and Suppression (ASS), which re-engineers the self-attention mechanism within the pre-trained diffusion models based on the given mask, thereby prioritizing the background over the foreground object during the reverse generation process. Moreover, we introduce Self-Attention Redirection Guidance (SARG), which utilizes the self-attention redirected by ASS to guide the generation process, effectively removing foreground objects within the mask while simultaneously generating content that is both plausible and coherent. Experiments demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of Attentive Eraser in object removal across a variety of pre-trained diffusion models, outperforming even training-based methods. Furthermore, Attentive Eraser can be implemented in various diffusion model architectures and checkpoints, enabling excellent scalability.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12990v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visual-based human action recognition can be found in various application fields, e.g., surveillance systems, sports analytics, medical assistive technologies, or human-robot interaction frameworks, and it concerns the identification and classification of individuals' activities within a video. Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.",

Specifically, measuring the elbow joint space in ultrasound images is used to assess the valgus instability of elbow. To automate this measurement, a precisely annotated dataset is necessary; however, no publicly available dataset has been proposed thus far. This study introduces a novel ultrasound medial elbow dataset for measuring joint space to diagnose Ulnar Collateral Ligament (UCL) injuries. The dataset comprises 4,201 medial elbow ultrasound images from 22 subjects, with landmark annotations on the humerus and ulna. The annotations are made precisely by the authors under the supervision of three orthopedic surgeons. We evaluated joint space measurement methods using our proposed dataset with several landmark detection approaches, including ViTPose, HRNet, PCT, YOLOv8, and U-Net. In addition, we propose using Shape Subspace (SS) for landmark refinement in heatmap-based landmark detection. The results show that the mean Euclidean distance error of joint space is 0.116 mm when using HRNet. Furthermore, the SS landmark refinement improves the mean absolute error of landmark positions by 0.010 mm with HRNet and by 0.103 mm with ViTPose on average. These highlight the potential for high-precision, real-time diagnosis of UCL injuries and associated risks, which could be leveraged in large-scale screening.

The dominant approaches to this task rely on neural networks trained to output a single prediction for each detected individual. In contrast, we propose CondiMen, a method that outputs a joint parametric distribution over likely poses, body shapes, intrinsics and distances to the camera, using a Bayesian network. This approach offers several advantages. First, a probability distribution can handle some inherent ambiguities of this task -- such as the uncertainty between a person's size and their distance to the camera, or simply the loss of information when projecting 3D data onto the 2D image plane. Second, the output distribution can be combined with additional information to produce better predictions, by using e.g. known camera or body shape parameters, or by exploiting multi-view observations. Third, one can efficiently extract the most likely predictions from the output distribution, making our proposed approach suitable for real-time applications. Empirically we find that our model i) achieves performance on par with or better than the state-of-the-art, ii) captures uncertainties and correlations inherent in pose estimation and iii) can exploit additional information at test time, such as multi-view consistency or body shape priors.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.13079v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: CNNs have become one of the most commonly used computational tool in the past two decades. One of the primary downsides of CNNs is that they work as a ``black box\", where the user cannot necessarily know how the image data are analyzed, and therefore needs to rely on empirical evaluation to test the efficacy of a trained CNN. This can lead to hidden biases that affect the performance evaluation of neural networks, but are difficult to identify. Here we discuss examples of such hidden biases in common and widely used benchmark datasets, and propose techniques for identifying dataset biases that can affect the standard performance evaluation metrics. One effective approach to identify dataset bias is to perform image classification by using merely blank background parts of the original images. However, in some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it more difficult to separate foreground or contextual information from the bias. To overcome this, we propose a method to identify dataset bias without the need to crop background information from the images. That method is based on applying several image transforms to the original images, including Fourier transform, wavelet transforms, median filter, and their combinations. These transforms were applied to recover background bias information that CNNs use to classify images. This transformations affect the contextual visual information in a different manner than it affects the systemic background bias. Therefore, the method can distinguish between contextual information and the bias, and alert on the presence of background bias even without the need to separate sub-images parts from the blank background of the original images. Code used in the experiments is publicly available.",

Most of the prior DFER methods model tightly coupled spatiotemporal representations which may incorporate weakly relevant features, leading to information redundancy and emotion-irrelevant context bias. Several DFER methods have highlighted the significance of dynamic information, but utilize explicit manners to extract dynamic features with overly strong prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel Implicit Facial Dynamics Disentanglement framework (IFDD). Through expanding wavelet lifting scheme to fully learnable framework, IFDD disentangles emotion-related dynamic information from emotion-irrelevant global context in an implicit manner, i.e., without exploit operations and external guidance. The disentanglement process of IFDD contains two stages, i.e., Inter-frame Static-dynamic Splitting Module (ISSM) for rough disentanglement estimation and Lifting-based Aggregation-Disentanglement Module (LADM) for further refinement. Specifically, ISSM explores inter-frame correlation to generate content-aware splitting indexes on-the-fly. We preliminarily utilize these indexes to split frame features into two groups, one with greater global similarity, and the other with more unique dynamic features. Subsequently, LADM first aggregates these two groups of features to obtain fine-grained global context features by an updater, and then disentangles emotion-related facial dynamic features from the global context by a predictor. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets have demonstrated that IFDD outperforms prior supervised DFER methods with higher recognition accuracy and comparable efficiency.",

To address this issue, we introduce ORFormer, a novel transformer-based method that can detect non-visible regions and recover their missing features from visible parts. Specifically, ORFormer associates each image patch token with one additional learnable token called the messenger token. The messenger token aggregates features from all but its patch. This way, the consensus between a patch and other patches can be assessed by referring to the similarity between its regular and messenger embeddings, enabling non-visible region identification. Our method then recovers occluded patches with features aggregated by the messenger tokens. Leveraging the recovered features, ORFormer compiles high-quality heatmaps for the downstream FLD task. Extensive experiments show that our method generates heatmaps resilient to partial occlusions. By integrating the resultant heatmaps into existing FLD methods, our method performs favorably against the state of the arts on challenging datasets such as WFLW and COFW.",

Existing dense SLAM algorithms often assume distant and static lighting and textured surfaces, and alternate between optimizing scene geometry and camera parameters by minimizing a photometric rendering loss, often called Photometric Bundle Adjustment. However, endoscopic environments exhibit dynamic near-field lighting due to the co-located light and camera moving extremely close to the surface, textureless surfaces, and strong specular reflections due to mucus layers. When not considered, these near-field lighting effects can cause significant performance reductions for existing SLAM algorithms from indoor/outdoor scenes when applied to endoscopy videos. To mitigate this problem, we introduce a new Near-Field Lighting Bundle Adjustment Loss $(L_{NFL-BA})$ that can also be alternatingly optimized, along with the Photometric Bundle Adjustment loss, such that the captured images' intensity variations match the relative distance and orientation between the surface and the co-located light and camera. We derive a general NFL-BA loss function for 3D Gaussian surface representations and demonstrate that adding $L_{NFL-BA}$ can significantly improve the tracking and mapping performance of two state-of-the-art 3DGS-SLAM systems, MonoGS (35% improvement in tracking, 48% improvement in mapping with predicted depth maps) and EndoGSLAM (22% improvement in tracking, marginal improvement in mapping with predicted depths), on the C3VD endoscopy dataset for colons.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.13179v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Discussions of minimum parking requirement policies often include maps of parking lots, which are time consuming to construct manually. Open source datasets for such parking lots are scarce, particularly for US cities. This paper introduces the idea of using Near-Infrared (NIR) channels as input and several post-processing techniques to improve the prediction of off-street surface parking lots using satellite imagery. We constructed two datasets with 12,617 image-mask pairs each: one with 3-channel (RGB) and another with 4-channel (RGB + NIR). The datasets were used to train five deep learning models (OneFormer, Mask2Former, SegFormer, DeepLabV3, and FCN) for semantic segmentation, classifying images to differentiate between parking and non-parking pixels. Our results demonstrate that the NIR channel improved accuracy because parking lots are often surrounded by grass, even though the NIR channel needed to be upsampled from a lower resolution. Post-processing including eliminating erroneous holes, simplifying edges, and removing road and building footprints further improved the accuracy. Best model, OneFormer trained on 4-channel input and paired with post-processing techniques achieves a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.9 percent and a pixel-wise accuracy of 96.3 percent.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.13180v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models show that strong performance can be maintained across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model and find that its strong performance across many tasks is not due to an exceptional ability to compress visual information, but rather the benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Namely, we demonstrate a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, this issue is only reflected in performance for a small subset of tasks such as localization. For the other evaluated tasks, strong performance is maintained with the flawed pruning strategy. Noting the limited visual capabilities of the studied acceleration technique, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that (1) resolves the identified issue with early-layer pruning, (2) incorporates uniform sampling to ensure coverage across all image regions, and (3) applies pruning in two stages to allow the criteria to become more effective at a later layer while still achieving significant speedup through early-layer pruning. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER has more than $5\\times$ performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.",

To ensure efficiency, recent methods leverage 2D CNNs operating in texture space to learn rendering primitives. However, they either jointly learn geometry and appearance, or completely ignore sparse image information for geometry estimation, significantly harming visual quality and robustness to unseen body poses. To address these issues, we present Double Unprojected Textures, which at the core disentangles coarse geometric deformation estimation from appearance synthesis, enabling robust and photorealistic 4K rendering in real-time. Specifically, we first introduce a novel image-conditioned template deformation network, which estimates the coarse deformation of the human template from a first unprojected texture. This updated geometry is then used to apply a second and more accurate texture unprojection. The resulting texture map has fewer artifacts and better alignment with input views, which benefits our learning of finer-level geometry and appearance represented by Gaussian splats. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method in quantitative and qualitative experiments, which significantly surpasses other state-of-the-art methods.",

We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of spatial-related data in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We address these issues with CoMPaSS, a versatile training framework that enhances spatial understanding of any T2I diffusion model. CoMPaSS solves the ambiguity of spatial-related data with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data through a set of principled spatial constraints. To better exploit the curated high-quality spatial priors, CoMPaSS further introduces a Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module to allow better exploitation of high-quality spatial priors, effectively compensating for the shortcoming of text encoders. Extensive experiments on four popular open-weight T2I diffusion models covering both UNet- and MMDiT-based architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMPaSS by setting new state-of-the-arts with substantial relative gains across well-known benchmarks on spatial relationships generation, including VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

It offers a unified framework that addresses two key stages of simulation: scene initialization, which involves generating initial traffic layouts, and scene rollout, which encompasses the closed-loop simulation of agent behaviors. While diffusion models have been proven effective in learning realistic and multimodal agent distributions, several challenges remain, including controllability, maintaining realism in closed-loop simulations, and ensuring inference efficiency. To address these issues, we introduce amortized diffusion for simulation. This novel diffusion denoising paradigm amortizes the computational cost of denoising over future simulation steps, significantly reducing the cost per rollout step (16x less inference steps) while also mitigating closed-loop errors. We further enhance controllability through the introduction of generalized hard constraints, a simple yet effective inference-time constraint mechanism, as well as language-based constrained scene generation via few-shot prompting of a large language model (LLM).

The primary challenges stem from model bias induced by pre-training on only known categories and the lack of precise supervision for novel ones, leading to category bias towards known categories and category confusion among different novel categories, which hinders models' ability to identify novel categories effectively. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named Self-Debiasing Calibration (SDC). Unlike prior methods that regard model bias towards known categories as an obstacle to novel category identification, SDC provides a novel insight into unleashing the potential of the bias to facilitate novel category learning. Specifically, the output of the biased model serves two key purposes. First, it provides an accurate modeling of category bias, which can be utilized to measure the degree of bias and debias the output of the current training model. Second, it offers valuable insights for distinguishing different novel categories by transferring knowledge between similar categories. Based on these insights, SDC dynamically adjusts the output logits of the current training model using the output of the biased model. This approach produces less biased logits to effectively address the issue of category bias towards known categories, and generates more accurate pseudo labels for unlabeled data, thereby mitigating category confusion for novel categories. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that SDC outperforms SOTA methods, especially in the identification of novel categories.

Recent methods address these limitations by tracing volumetric particles instead, however, this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering speeds. In this work, we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT), replacing the EWA splatting formulation in 3DGS with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points, which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter, while retaining the efficiency of rasterization.

However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively, objectively and accurately evaluate whether LMMs align with the diverse needs of humans in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Dimensional Insights (MDI) benchmark, which includes over 500 images covering six common scenarios of human life. Notably, the MDI-Benchmark offers two significant advantages over existing evaluations: (1) Each image is accompanied by two types of questions: simple questions to assess the model's understanding of the image, and complex questions to evaluate the model's ability to analyze and reason beyond basic content. (2) Recognizing that people of different age groups have varying needs and perspectives when faced with the same scenario, our benchmark stratifies questions into three age categories: young people, middle-aged people, and older people. This design allows for a detailed assessment of LMMs' capabilities in meeting the preferences and needs of different age groups. With MDI-Benchmark, the strong model like GPT-4o achieve 79% accuracy on age-related tasks, indicating that existing LMMs still have considerable room for improvement in addressing real-world applications.

These models have opened new avenues for developing unified biomedical assistants capable of analyzing biomedical images, answering complex questions about them, and predicting the impact of medical procedures on a patient's health. However, existing resources face challenges such as limited data availability, narrow domain coverage, and restricted sources (e.g., medical papers). To address these gaps, we present MedMax, the first large-scale multimodal biomedical instruction-tuning dataset for mixed-modal foundation models. With 1.47 million instances, MedMax encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including multimodal content generation (interleaved image-text data), biomedical image captioning and generation, visual chatting, and report understanding. These tasks span diverse medical domains such as radiology and histopathology. Subsequently, we fine-tune a mixed-modal foundation model on the MedMax dataset, achieving significant performance improvements: a 26% gain over the Chameleon model and an 18.3% improvement over GPT-4o across 12 downstream biomedical visual question-answering tasks. Additionally, we introduce a unified evaluation suite for biomedical tasks, providing a robust framework to guide the development of next-generation mixed-modal biomedical AI assistants.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12709v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\\theta_\\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\\sigma$ for systems with $\\theta_\\mathrm{E}<3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z>1.5$ sources, the number of candidates is reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.",

This monitoring allows us to pause and fix the training method if the representations or distributions progress undesirably.

Deep learning based methods for the segmentation of LVC are the state of the art; however, these methods are generally formulated to work on single time points, and fails to exploit the complementary information from the temporal image sequences that can aid in segmentation accuracy and consistency among the images across the time points. Furthermore, these segmentation methods perform poorly in segmenting the end-systole (ES) phase images, where the left ventricle deforms to the smallest irregular shape, and the boundary between the blood chamber and myocardium becomes inconspicuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method to automatically segment temporal cardiac images where we introduce a spatial sequential (SS) network to learn the deformation and motion characteristics of the LVC in an unsupervised manner; these characteristics were then integrated with sequential context information derived from bi-directional learning (BL) where both chronological and reverse-chronological directions of the image sequence were used. Our experimental results on a cardiac computed tomography (CT) dataset demonstrated that our spatial-sequential network with bi-directional learning (SS-BL) method outperformed existing methods for LVC segmentation. Our method was also applied to MRI cardiac dataset and the results demonstrated the generalizability of our method.",

Existing methods often produce suboptimal results or require excessive computation time. In this work, we propose 4D radiative Gaussian splatting (4DRGS) to achieve high-quality reconstruction efficiently. In detail, we represent the vessels with 4D radiative Gaussian kernels. Each kernel has time-invariant geometry parameters, including position, rotation, and scale, to model static vessel structures. The time-dependent central attenuation of each kernel is predicted from a compact neural network to capture the temporal varying response of contrast agent flow. We splat these Gaussian kernels to synthesize DSA images via X-ray rasterization and optimize the model with real captured ones. The final 3D vessel volume is voxelized from the well-trained kernels. Moreover, we introduce accumulated attenuation pruning and bounded scaling activation to improve reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on real-world patient data demonstrate that 4DRGS achieves impressive results in 5 minutes training, which is 32x faster than the state-of-the-art method.

However, there is a noticeable deficiency in research focused on compression methods for AIGIs. To address this critical gap, we introduce a scalable cross-modal compression framework that incorporates multiple human-comprehensible modalities, designed to efficiently capture and relay essential visual information for AIGIs. In particular, our framework encodes images into a layered bitstream consisting of a semantic layer that delivers high-level semantic information through text prompts; a structural layer that captures spatial details using edge or skeleton maps; and a texture layer that preserves local textures via a colormap. Utilizing Stable Diffusion as the backend, the framework effectively leverages these multimodal priors for image generation, effectively functioning as a decoder when these priors are encoded. Qualitative and quantitative results show that our method proficiently restores both semantic and visual details, competing against baseline approaches at extremely low bitrates ( <0.02 bpp). Additionally, our framework facilitates downstream editing applications without requiring full decoding, thereby paving a new direction for future research in AIGI compression.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.13099v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Biometric systems are widely used for identity verification and identification, including authentication (i.e., one-to-one matching to verify a claimed identity) and identification (i.e., one-to-many matching to find a subject in a database). The matching process relies on measuring similarities or dissimilarities between a fresh biometric template and enrolled templates. The False Match Rate FMR is a key metric for assessing the accuracy and reliability of such systems. This paper analyzes biometric systems based on their FMR, with two main contributions. First, we explore untargeted attacks, where an adversary aims to impersonate any user within a database. We determine the number of trials required for an attacker to successfully impersonate a user and derive the critical population size (i.e., the maximum number of users in the database) required to maintain a given level of security. Furthermore, we compute the critical FMR value needed to ensure resistance against untargeted attacks as the database size increases. Second, we revisit the biometric birthday problem to evaluate the approximate and exact probabilities that two users in a database collide (i.e., can impersonate each other). Based on this analysis, we derive both the approximate critical population size and the critical FMR value needed to bound the likelihood of such collisions occurring with a given probability. These thresholds offer insights for designing systems that mitigate the risk of impersonation and collisions, particularly in large-scale biometric databases. Our findings indicate that current biometric systems fail to deliver sufficient accuracy to achieve an adequate security level against untargeted attacks, even in small-scale databases. Moreover, state-of-the-art systems face significant challenges in addressing the biometric birthday problem, especially as database sizes grow.",

Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs. Validated on 18 diverse benchmarks with more than 14,000 whole slide images (WSIs), KEEP achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot cancer diagnostic tasks. Notably, for cancer detection, KEEP demonstrates an average sensitivity of 89.8% at a specificity of 95.0% across 7 cancer types.

While current digital pathology solutions rely on lossy JPEG compression to address this issue, lossy compression can introduce color and texture disparities, potentially impacting clinical decision-making. While prior research addresses perceptual image quality and downstream performance independently of each other, we jointly evaluate compression schemes for perceptual and downstream task quality on four different datasets. In addition, we collect an initially uncompressed dataset for an unbiased perceptual evaluation of compression schemes. Our results show that deep learning models fine-tuned for perceptual quality outperform conventional compression schemes like JPEG-XL or WebP for further compression of WSI. However, they exhibit a significant bias towards the compression artifacts present in the training data and struggle to generalize across various compression schemes. We introduce a novel evaluation metric based on feature similarity between original files and compressed files that aligns very well with the actual downstream performance on the compressed WSI. Our metric allows for a general and standardized evaluation of lossy compression schemes and mitigates the requirement to independently assess different downstream tasks. Our study provides novel insights for the assessment of lossy compression schemes for WSI and encourages a unified evaluation of lossy compression schemes to accelerate the clinical uptake of digital pathology.",

Such a generalist agent needs to have a large and diverse skill repertoire, such as finding directions between two travel locations and buying specific items from the Internet. If each skill needs to be specified manually through a fixed set of human-annotated instructions, the agent's skill repertoire will necessarily be limited due to the quantity and diversity of human-annotated instructions. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing Proposer-Agent-Evaluator, an effective learning system that enables foundation model agents to autonomously discover and practice skills in the wild. At the heart of PAE is a context-aware task proposer that autonomously proposes tasks for the agent to practice with context information of the environment such as user demos or even just the name of the website itself for Internet-browsing agents. Then, the agent policy attempts those tasks with thoughts and actual grounded operations in the real world with resulting trajectories evaluated by an autonomous VLM-based success evaluator. The success evaluation serves as the reward signal for the agent to refine its policies through RL. We validate PAE on challenging vision-based web navigation, using both real-world and self-hosted websites from WebVoyager and WebArena.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effective learning system to apply autonomous task proposal with RL for agents that generalizes real-world human-annotated benchmarks with SOTA performances.

    "summary": "arXiv:2310.12848v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Existing methods have demonstrated effective performance on a single degradation type. In practical applications, however, the degradation is often unknown, and the mismatch between the model and the degradation will result in a severe performance drop. In this paper, we propose an all-in-one image restoration network that tackles multiple degradations. Due to the heterogeneous nature of different types of degradations, it is difficult to process multiple degradations in a single network. To this end, we propose to learn a neural degradation representation (NDR) that captures the underlying characteristics of various degradations. The learned NDR decomposes different types of degradations adaptively, similar to a neural dictionary that represents basic degradation components. Subsequently, we develop a degradation query module and a degradation injection module to effectively recognize and utilize the specific degradation based on NDR, enabling the all-in-one restoration ability for multiple degradations. Moreover, we propose a bidirectional optimization strategy to effectively drive NDR to learn the degradation representation by optimizing the degradation and restoration processes alternately. Comprehensive experiments on representative types of degradations (including noise, haze, rain, and downsampling) demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our method.",

One immensely popular line of work utilizes frozen unimodal models, by bridging vision representations to language using a trainable module called the QFormer. However, this method relies heavily on large-scale multimodal pretraining with huge computational overheads. To that end, we propose a more efficient framework for QFormer-based vision-language alignment. Our key idea relies on the observation that QFormer latents correspond more strongly to the frozen LLM's intermediate latent space. Consequently, instead of using QFormer latents as inputs to the LLM, we alter the framework by using the latents to directly condition the LLM latent space for image-to-text generation.

To address this problem in automobile lane-keeping control without the use of additional smoothing algorithms, we developed a novel soft-constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (soft-CILQR) algorithm by integrating CILQR algorithm and a model predictive control (MPC) constraint relaxation method. We incorporated slack variables into the state and control barrier functions of the soft-CILQR solver to soften the constraints in the optimization process such that control input stabilization can be achieved in a computationally simple manner. Two types of automotive lane-keeping experiments (numerical simulations and experiments involving challenging vision-based maneuvers) were conducted with a linear system dynamics model to test the performance of the proposed soft-CILQR algorithm, and its performance was compared with that of the CILQR algorithm. In the numerical simulations, the soft-CILQR and CILQR solvers managed to drive the system toward the reference state asymptotically; however, the soft-CILQR solver obtained smooth steering input trajectories more easily than did the CILQR solver under conditions involving additive disturbances. The results of the vision-based experiments in which an ego vehicle drove in perturbed TORCS environments with various road friction settings were consistent with those of the numerical tests. The proposed soft-CILQR algorithm achieved an average runtime of 2.55 ms and is thus applicable for real-time autonomous driving scenarios.",

Since precise pixel-level annotations are not accessible, existing methods typically focus on producing pseudo masks for training segmentation models by refining CAM-like heatmaps. However, the produced heatmaps may capture only the discriminative image regions of object categories or the associated co-occurring backgrounds. To address the issues, we propose a Semantic Prompt Learning for WSSS (SemPLeS) framework, which learns to effectively prompt the CLIP latent space to enhance the semantic alignment between the segmented regions and the target object categories. More specifically, we propose Contrastive Prompt Learning and Prompt-guided Semantic Refinement to learn the prompts that adequately describe and suppress the co-occurring backgrounds associated with each object category. In this way, SemPLeS can perform better semantic alignment between object regions and class labels, resulting in desired pseudo masks for training segmentation models.

Existing de-biasing works tackle most prominent bias features, like colors of digits or background of animals. However, a real-world dataset often includes a large number of feature correlations, that manifest intrinsically in the data as common sense information. Such spurious visual cues can further reduce model robustness. Thus, practitioners desire the whole picture of correlations and flexibility to treat concerned bias for specific domain tasks. With this goal, we propose a novel framework to extract comprehensive bias information in image datasets based on textual descriptions, a common sense-rich modality. Specifically, features are constructed by clustering noun phrase embeddings of similar semantics. Each feature's appearance across a dataset is inferred and their co-occurrence statistics are measured, with spurious correlations optionally examined by a human-in-the-loop interface. Downstream experiments show that our method discovers novel model biases on multiple image benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the discovered bias can be mitigated by a simple data re-weighting strategy that de-correlates the features, and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised bias mitigation methods.",

However, the existing techniques, particularly those employing different augmentations of the same image, often rely on a limited set of simple transformations that cannot fully capture variations in the real world. This constrains the diversity and quality of samples, which leads to sub-optimal representations. In this paper, we introduce a framework that enriches the self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm by utilizing generative models to produce semantically consistent image augmentations. By directly conditioning generative models on a source image, our method enables the generation of diverse augmentations while maintaining the semantics of the source image, thus offering a richer set of data for SSL. Our extensive experimental results on various joint-embedding SSL techniques demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the quality of learned visual representations by up to 10\\% Top-1 accuracy in downstream tasks. This research demonstrates that incorporating generative models into the joint-embedding SSL workflow opens new avenues for exploring the potential of synthetic data.

However, this requirement limits its broader applicability, as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is often unreliable in sparse-view scenarios where feature matches are limited, resulting in cumulative errors. In this paper, we introduce InstantSplat, a novel and lightning-fast neural reconstruction system that builds accurate 3D representations from as few as 2-3 images. InstantSplat adopts a self-supervised framework that bridges the gap between 2D images and 3D representations using Gaussian Bundle Adjustment (GauBA) and can be optimized in an end-to-end manner. InstantSplat integrates dense stereo priors and co-visibility relationships between frames to initialize pixel-aligned geometry by progressively expanding the scene avoiding redundancy. Gaussian Bundle Adjustment is used to adapt both the scene representation and camera parameters quickly by minimizing gradient-based photometric error. Overall, InstantSplat achieves large-scale 3D reconstruction in mere seconds by reducing the required number of input views. It achieves an acceleration of over 20 times in reconstruction, improves visual quality (SSIM) from 0.3755 to 0.7624 than COLMAP with 3D-GS, and is compatible with multiple 3D representations (3D-GS, 2D-GS, and Mip-Splatting).",

However, most existing BSNs are conducted with convolution layers. Although transformers have shown the potential to overcome the limitations of convolutions in many image restoration tasks, the attention mechanisms may violate the blind-spot requirement, thereby restricting their applicability in BSN. To this end, we propose to analyze and redesign the channel and spatial attentions to meet the blind-spot requirement. Specifically, channel self-attention may leak the blind-spot information in multi-scale architectures, since the downsampling shuffles the spatial feature into channel dimensions. To alleviate this problem, we divide the channel into several groups and perform channel attention separately. For spatial selfattention, we apply an elaborate mask to the attention matrix to restrict and mimic the receptive field of dilated convolution. Based on the redesigned channel and window attentions, we build a Transformer-based Blind-Spot Network (TBSN), which shows strong local fitting and global perspective abilities. Furthermore, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that distills TBSN into smaller denoisers to improve computational efficiency while maintaining performance. Extensive experiments on real-world image denoising datasets show that TBSN largely extends the receptive field and exhibits favorable performance against state-of-theart SSID methods.",

Despite the significant advancements in customized generation methods, particularly with the success of diffusion models, existing methods often struggle with multi-concept scenarios due to low concept fidelity and high inference cost. MultiBooth addresses these issues by dividing the multi-concept generation process into two phases: a single-concept learning phase and a multi-concept integration phase. During the single-concept learning phase, we employ a multi-modal image encoder and an efficient concept encoding technique to learn a concise and discriminative representation for each concept. In the multi-concept integration phase, we use bounding boxes to define the generation area for each concept within the cross-attention map. This method enables the creation of individual concepts within their specified regions, thereby facilitating the formation of multi-concept images. This strategy not only improves concept fidelity but also reduces additional inference cost. MultiBooth surpasses various baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, showcasing its superior performance and computational efficiency.

However, we reveal that MLLMs often generate incorrect answers even when they understand the visual content. To this end, we manually construct a benchmark with 12 categories and design evaluation metrics that assess the degree of error in MLLM responses even when the visual content is seemingly understood. Based on this benchmark, we test 15 leading MLLMs and analyze the distribution of attention maps and logits of some MLLMs. Our investigation identifies two primary issues: 1) most instruction tuning datasets predominantly feature questions that 'directly' relate to the visual content, leading to a bias in MLLMs' responses to other indirect questions, and 2) MLLMs' attention to visual tokens is notably lower than to system and question tokens. We further observe that attention scores between questions and visual tokens as well as the model's confidence in the answers are lower in response to misleading questions than to straightforward ones. To address the first challenge, we introduce a paired positive and negative data construction pipeline to diversify the dataset. For the second challenge, we propose to enhance the model's focus on visual content during decoding by refining the text and visual prompt. For the text prompt, we propose a content guided refinement strategy that performs preliminary visual content analysis to generate structured information before answering the question. Additionally, we employ a visual attention refinement strategy that highlights question-relevant visual tokens to increase the model's attention to visual content that aligns with the question.

However, they suffer from two major limitations; first, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits the number of tokens that can be processed, and second, Transformers often require large amounts of training data to attain state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a new multi-head self-attention (MHSA) variant named Fibottention, which can replace MHSA in Transformer architectures. Fibottention is data-efficient and computationally more suitable for processing large numbers of tokens than the standard MHSA. It employs structured sparse attention based on dilated Fibonacci sequences, which, uniquely, differ across attention heads, resulting in inception-like diverse features across heads. The spacing of the Fibonacci sequences follows the Wythoff array, which minimizes the redundancy of token interactions aggregated across different attention heads, while still capturing sufficient complementary information through token pair interactions. These sparse attention patterns are unique among the existing sparse attention and lead to an $O(N \\log N)$ complexity, where $N$ is the number of tokens. Leveraging only 2-6% of the elements in the self-attention heads, Fibottention embedded into popular, state-of-the-art Transformer architectures can achieve significantly improved predictive performance for domains with limited data such as image classification, video understanding, and robot learning tasks, and render reduced computational complexity.

A constant challenge in the analysis of digital Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is the problem of aggregating tens of thousands of tile-level image embeddings to a slide-level representation. Due to the prevalent use of datasets created for genomic research, such as TCGA, for method development, the performance of these techniques on diagnostic slides from clinical practice has been inadequately explored. This study conducts a thorough benchmarking analysis of ten slide-level aggregation techniques across nine clinically relevant tasks, including diagnostic assessment, biomarker classification, and outcome prediction. The results yield following key insights: (1) Embeddings derived from domain-specific (histological images) FMs outperform those from generic ImageNet-based models across aggregation methods. (2) Spatial-aware aggregators enhance the performance significantly when using ImageNet pre-trained models but not when using FMs. (3) No single model excels in all tasks and spatially-aware models do not show general superiority as it would be expected.

However, simple image enlargement is significantly expensive on both computations and GPU memory. In fact, small objects are usually sparsely distributed and locally clustered. Therefore, massive feature extraction computations are wasted on the non-target background area of images. Recent works have tried to pick out target-containing regions using an extra network and perform conventional object detection, but the newly introduced computation limits their final performance. In this paper, we propose to reuse the detector's backbone to conduct feature-level object-seeking and patch-slicing, which can avoid redundant feature extraction and reduce the computation cost. Incorporating a sparse detection head, we are able to detect small objects on high-resolution inputs (e.g., 1080P or larger) for superior performance.

Upon these insights, we propose a systemic captioning framework, achieving various modality annotations with more than 27.1k hours of trailer videos. Here, to ensure the caption retains music perspective while preserving the authority of visual context, we leverage the advanced LLM to merge all annotations adaptively. In this fashion, our MMtrail dataset potentially paves the path for fine-grained large multimodal-language model training. In experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, demonstrating the high quality of our annotation and its effectiveness for model training.",

We propose utilizing LLMs to generate both contextually canonical phrases and helping positive words for enhanced segmentation and scene interpretation. Our method leverages GPT-3.5 Turbo as an expert model to create a high-quality text dataset, which we then use to fine-tune smaller, more efficient LLMs for on-device deployment. Our comprehensive evaluation on the WayveScenes101 dataset demonstrates that LLM-guided segmentation significantly outperforms traditional approaches based on predefined canonical phrases. Notably, our fine-tuned smaller models achieve performance comparable to larger expert models while maintaining faster inference times. Through ablation studies, we discover that the effectiveness of helping positive words correlates with model scale, with larger models better equipped to leverage additional semantic information. This work represents a significant advancement towards more efficient, context-aware autonomous driving systems, effectively bridging 3D scene representation with high-level semantic querying while maintaining practical deployment considerations.",

Recent studies highlight their ability to apply desired edits effectively by following textual instructions, yet with two key challenges remaining. First, these models struggle to apply multiple edits simultaneously, resulting in computational inefficiencies due to their reliance on sequential processing. Second, relying on textual prompts to determine the editing region can lead to unintended alterations to the image. We introduce FunEditor, an efficient diffusion model designed to learn atomic editing functions and perform complex edits by aggregating simpler functions. This approach enables complex editing tasks, such as object movement, by aggregating multiple functions and applying them simultaneously to specific areas. Our experiments demonstrate that FunEditor significantly outperforms recent inference-time optimization methods and fine-tuned models, either quantitatively across various metrics or through visual comparisons or both, on complex tasks like object movement and object pasting.

The former presents challenges in real-time capturing of short-term PM, while the latter involves the intraoperative discrimination of long-term liver ischemia states. To address these challenges, we meticulously collect a novel dataset, called PmLR50, consisting of 25,037 video frames covering various surgical phases from 50 laparoscopic liver resection procedures. Additionally, we develop an online baseline for PmLR50, termed PmNet. This model embraces Masked Temporal Encoding (MTE) and Compressed Sequence Modeling (CSM) for efficient short-term and long-term temporal information modeling, and embeds Contrastive Prototype Separation (CPS) to enhance action discrimination between similar intraoperative operations.

ScreenMark utilizes a three-stage progressive watermarking framework. Initially, inspired by diffusion principles, we initialize the mutual transformation between regular watermark information and irregular watermark patterns. Subsequently, these patterns are integrated with screen content using a pre-multiplication alpha blending technique, supported by a pre-trained screen decoder for accurate watermark retrieval. The progressively complex distorter enhances the robustness of the watermark in real-world screenshot scenarios. Finally, the model undergoes fine-tuning guided by a joint-level distorter to ensure optimal performance.

Although optimized in a planning-oriented spirit with a fully differentiable framework, existing end-to-end driving systems without ego-centric designs still suffer from unsatisfactory performance and inferior efficiency, owing to the rasterized scene representation learning and redundant information transmission. In this paper, we revisit the human driving behavior and propose an ego-centric fully sparse paradigm, named DiFSD, for end-to-end self-driving. Specifically, DiFSD mainly consists of sparse perception, hierarchical interaction and iterative motion planner. The sparse perception module performs detection, tracking and online mapping based on sparse representation of the driving scene. The hierarchical interaction module aims to select the Closest In-Path Vehicle / Stationary (CIPV / CIPS) from coarse to fine, benefiting from an additional geometric prior. As for the iterative motion planner, both selected interactive agents and ego-vehicle are considered for joint motion prediction, where the output multi-modal ego-trajectories are optimized in an iterative fashion. Besides, both position-level motion diffusion and trajectory-level planning denoising are introduced for uncertainty modeling, thus facilitating the training stability and convergence of the whole framework. Extensive experiments conducted on nuScenes and Bench2Drive datasets demonstrate the superior planning performance and great efficiency of DiFSD.",

The crucial design of SAM 2 for video segmentation is its memory module, which prompts object-aware memories from previous frames for current frame prediction. However, its greedy-selection memory design suffers from the \"error accumulation\" problem, where an errored or missed mask will cascade and influence the segmentation of the subsequent frames, which limits the performance of SAM 2 toward complex long-term videos. To this end, we introduce SAM2Long, an improved training-free video object segmentation strategy, which considers the segmentation uncertainty within each frame and chooses the video-level optimal results from multiple segmentation pathways in a constrained tree search manner. In practice, we maintain a fixed number of segmentation pathways throughout the video. For each frame, multiple masks are proposed based on the existing pathways, creating various candidate branches. We then select the same fixed number of branches with higher cumulative scores as the new pathways for the next frame. After processing the final frame, the pathway with the highest cumulative score is chosen as the final segmentation result. Benefiting from its heuristic search design, SAM2Long is robust toward occlusions and object reappearances, and can effectively segment and track objects for complex long-term videos. Notably, SAM2Long achieves an average improvement of 3.0 points across all 24 head-to-head comparisons, with gains of up to 5.3 points in J&F on long-term video object segmentation benchmarks such as SA-V and LVOS.

To address these challenges, we propose DreamRunner, a novel story-to-video generation method: First, we structure the input script using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate both coarse-grained scene planning as well as fine-grained object-level layout and motion planning. Next, DreamRunner presents retrieval-augmented test-time adaptation to capture target motion priors for objects in each scene, supporting diverse motion customization based on retrieved videos, thus facilitating the generation of new videos with complex, scripted motions.

MAT leverages the computational advantages inherent in dilation operation, in conjunction with self-attention mechanism, to facilitate both multi-range attention (MA) and sparse multi-range attention (SMA), enabling efficient capture of both regional and sparse global features. Further coupled with local feature extraction, MAT adeptly capture dependencies across various spatial ranges, improving the diversity and efficacy of its feature representations.

To address this problem, we proposed a dynamic vision-language context sparsification framework Dynamic-LLaVA, which dynamically reduces the redundancy of vision context in the prefill stage and decreases the memory and computation overhead of the generated language context during decoding. Dynamic-LLaVA designs a tailored sparsification inference scheme for different inference modes, i.e., prefill, decoding with and without KV cache, to achieve efficient inference of MLLMs. In practice, Dynamic-LLaVA can reduce computation consumption by $\\sim$75\\% in the prefill stage.

In real-world scenarios, we are generally confronted with the dynamic scenario where the data comes in a streaming manner. Driven by the practical need, in this paper, we first propose a novel Continual SAM adaptation (CoSAM) benchmark with 8 different task domains and carefully analyze the limitations of the existing SAM one-step adaptation methods in the continual segmentation scenario. Then we propose a novel simple-yet-effective Mixture of Domain Adapters (MoDA) algorithm which utilizes the Global Feature Tokens (GFT) and Global Assistant Tokens (GAT) modules to help the SAM encoder extract well-separated features for different task domains, and then provide the accurate task-specific information for continual learning.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.07375v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Story visualization has gained increasing attention in artificial intelligence. However, existing methods still struggle with maintaining a balance between character identity preservation and text-semantics alignment, largely due to a lack of detailed semantic modeling of the story scene. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel knowledge graph, namely Character Graph (\\textbf{CG}), which comprehensively represents various story-related knowledge, including the characters, the attributes related to characters, and the relationship between characters. We then introduce StoryWeaver, an image generator that achieve Customization via Character Graph (\\textbf{C-CG}), capable of consistent story visualization with rich text semantics. To further improve the multi-character generation performance, we incorporate knowledge-enhanced spatial guidance (\\textbf{KE-SG}) into StoryWeaver to precisely inject character semantics into generation. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, extensive experiments are conducted using a new benchmark called TBC-Bench. The experiments confirm that our StoryWeaver excels not only in creating vivid visual story plots but also in accurately conveying character identities across various scenarios with considerable storage efficiency, \\emph{e.g.}, achieving an average increase of +9.03\\% DINO-I and +13.44\\% CLIP-T.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.08939v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable yet challenging approach that enhances a compact student network by learning from a high-performance but cumbersome teacher model. However, previous KD methods for image restoration overlook the state of the student during the distillation, adopting a fixed solution space that limits the capability of KD. Additionally, relying solely on L1-type loss struggles to leverage the distribution information of images. In this work, we propose a novel dynamic contrastive knowledge distillation (DCKD) framework for image restoration. Specifically, we introduce dynamic contrastive regularization to perceive the student's learning state and dynamically adjust the distilled solution space using contrastive learning. Additionally, we also propose a distribution mapping module to extract and align the pixel-level category distribution of the teacher and student models. Note that the proposed DCKD is a structure-agnostic distillation framework, which can adapt to different backbones and can be combined with methods that optimize upper-bound constraints to further enhance model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCKD significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods across various image restoration tasks and backbones.",

Inpainting is one such application that can benefit significantly from diffusion models. Existing methods either hijack the reverse process of a pretrained diffusion model or cast the problem into a larger framework, \\ie, conditioned generation. However, these approaches often require nested loops in the generation process or additional components for conditioning. In this paper, we present region-aware diffusion models (RAD) for inpainting with a simple yet effective reformulation of the vanilla diffusion models. RAD utilizes a different noise schedule for each pixel, which allows local regions to be generated asynchronously while considering the global image context. A plain reverse process requires no additional components, enabling RAD to achieve inference time up to 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we employ low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune RAD based on other pretrained diffusion models, reducing computational burdens in training as well.

Existing LReID approaches typically rely on data replay and knowledge distillation to mitigate this issue. However, data replay methods compromise data privacy by storing historical exemplars, while knowledge distillation methods suffer from limited performance due to the cumulative forgetting of undistilled knowledge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel paradigm that models and rehearses the distribution of the old domains to enhance knowledge consolidation during the new data learning, possessing a strong anti-forgetting capacity without storing any exemplars. Specifically, we introduce an exemplar-free LReID method called Distribution Rehearsing via Adaptive Style Kernel Learning (DASK). DASK includes a Distribution Rehearser Learning (DRL) mechanism that learns to transform arbitrary distribution data into the current data style at each learning step. To enhance the style transfer capacity of DRL, an Adaptive Kernel Prediction Network (AKPNet) is explored to achieve an instance-specific distribution adjustment. Additionally, we design a Distribution Rehearsing-driven LReID Training (DRRT) module, which rehearses old distribution based on the new data via the old AKPNet model, achieving effective new-old knowledge accumulation under a joint knowledge consolidation scheme. Experimental results show our DASK outperforms the existing methods by 3.6%-6.8% and 4.5%-6.5% on anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively.

Our approach is motivated by the scientific study of beneficial noise, namely Positive-incentive Noise (Pi-noise or $\\pi$-noise) , which quantitatively analyzes the impact of noise. It therefore implies a new scheme to learn beneficial noise distribution that can be employed to fine-tune VL models. Focusing on few-shot classification tasks based on CLIP, we reformulate the inference process of CLIP and apply variational inference, demonstrating how to generate $\\pi$-noise towards visual and linguistic modalities. Then, we propose Positive-incentive Noise Injector (PiNI), which can fine-tune CLIP via injecting noise into both visual and text encoders. Since the proposed method can learn the distribution of beneficial noise, we can obtain more diverse embeddings of vision and language to better align these two modalities for specific downstream tasks within limited computational resources.

However, existing text-to-image diffusion models often fail to maintain high image quality and high prompt-image alignment for those challenging prompts. To mitigate this issue and enhance existing pretrained diffusion models, we mainly made three contributions in this paper. First, we propose diffusion self-reflection that alternately performs denoising and inversion and demonstrate that such diffusion self-reflection can leverage the guidance gap between denoising and inversion to capture prompt-related semantic information with theoretical and empirical evidence. Second, motivated by theoretical analysis, we derive Zigzag Diffusion Sampling (Z-Sampling), a novel self-reflection-based diffusion sampling method that leverages the guidance gap between denosing and inversion to accumulate semantic information step by step along the sampling path, leading to improved sampling results. Moreover, as a plug-and-play method, Z-Sampling can be generally applied to various diffusion models (e.g., accelerated ones and Transformer-based ones) with very limited coding and computational costs. Third, our extensive experiments demonstrate that Z-Sampling can generally and significantly enhance generation quality across various benchmark datasets, diffusion models, and performance evaluation metrics. For example, DreamShaper with Z-Sampling can self-improve with the HPSv2 winning rate up to 94% over the original results.

Capturing accurate event semantics for each audio/visual segment is vital. Prior works directly utilize the extracted holistic audio and visual features for intra- and cross-modal temporal interactions. However, each segment may contain multiple events, resulting in semantically mixed holistic features that can lead to semantic interference during intra- or cross-modal interactions: the event semantics of one segment may incorporate semantics of unrelated events from other segments. To address this issue, our method begins with a Class-Aware Feature Decoupling (CAFD) module, which explicitly decouples the semantically mixed features into distinct class-wise features, including multiple event-specific features and a dedicated background feature. The decoupled class-wise features enable our model to selectively aggregate useful semantics for each segment from clearly matched classes contained in other segments, preventing semantic interference from irrelevant classes. Specifically, we further design a Fine-Grained Semantic Enhancement module for encoding intra- and cross-modal relations. It comprises a Segment-wise Event Co-occurrence Modeling (SECM) block and a Local-Global Semantic Fusion (LGSF) block. The SECM exploits inter-class dependencies of concurrent events within the same timestamp with the aid of a new event co-occurrence loss. The LGSF further enhances the event semantics of each segment by incorporating relevant semantics from more informative global video features. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules and loss functions, resulting in a new state-of-the-art parsing performance.",

The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.11620v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Noisy labels can negatively impact the performance of deep neural networks. One common solution is label refurbishment, which involves reconstructing noisy labels through predictions and distributions. However, these methods may introduce problematic semantic associations, a phenomenon that we identify as Semantic Contamination. Through an analysis of Robust LR, a representative label refurbishment method, we found that utilizing the logits of views for refurbishment does not adequately balance the semantic information of individual classes. Conversely, using the logits of models fails to maintain consistent semantic relationships across models, which explains why label refurbishment methods frequently encounter issues related to Semantic Contamination. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Collaborative Cross Learning, which utilizes semi-supervised learning on refurbished labels to extract appropriate semantic associations from embeddings across views and models. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, effectively mitigating the impact of label noise and Semantic Contamination.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.11892v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In this paper, we present CAD2Program, a new method for reconstructing 3D parametric models from 2D CAD drawings. Our proposed method is inspired by recent successes in vision-language models (VLMs), and departs from traditional methods which rely on task-specific data representations and/or algorithms. Specifically, on the input side, we simply treat the 2D CAD drawing as a raster image, regardless of its original format, and encode the image with a standard ViT model. We show that such an encoding scheme achieves competitive performance against existing methods that operate on vector-graphics inputs, while imposing substantially fewer restrictions on the 2D drawings. On the output side, our method auto-regressively predicts a general-purpose language describing 3D parametric models in text form. Compared to other sequence modeling methods for CAD which use domain-specific sequence representations with fixed-size slots, our text-based representation is more flexible, and can be easily extended to arbitrary geometric entities and semantic or functional properties. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset of cabinet models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",

While existing models excel in directly generating multi-track mix, their limitations become evident when it comes to composing individual tracks and integrating them in a controllable manner.

We introduce a progressive curriculum training strategy, which gradually escalates the difficulty of training tasks while ensuring the model's generalization ability and facilitating smooth transitions between different scenarios.

Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.",

The on-device learning at edge relies on device-to-device wireless communication to facilitate real-time data sharing and collaborative decision-making among multiple devices. This significantly improves the adaptability of the edge computing system to the changing environments. However, as the scale of the edge computing system is getting larger, communication among devices is becoming the bottleneck because of the limited bandwidth of wireless communication leads to large data transfer latency. To reduce the amount of device-to-device data transmission and accelerate on-device learning, in this paper, we propose Residual-INR, a fog computing-based communication-efficient on-device learning framework by utilizing implicit neural representation (INR) to compress images/videos into neural network weights. Residual-INR enhances data transfer efficiency by collecting JPEG images from edge devices, compressing them into INR format at the fog node, and redistributing them for on-device learning. By using a smaller INR for full image encoding and a separate object INR for high-quality object region reconstruction through residual encoding, our technique can reduce the encoding redundancy while maintaining the object quality. Residual-INR is a promising solution for edge on-device learning because it reduces data transmission by up to 5.16 x across a network of 10 edge devices. It also facilitates CPU-free accelerated on-device learning, achieving up to 2.9 x speedup without sacrificing accuracy. Our code is available at: https://github.com/sharc-lab/Residual-INR.",

To counteract the catastrophic forgetting typically encountered in FSCIL, knowledge distillation is employed as a way to maintain the knowledge from learned data distribution. Recognizing the limitations of generating discriminative feature representations in a few-shot context, our approach incorporates structural information between samples into knowledge distillation. This structural information serves as a remedy for the low quality of features. Diverging from traditional structured distillation methods that compute sample similarity, we introduce the Displacement Knowledge Distillation (DKD) method. DKD utilizes displacement rather than similarity between samples, incorporating both distance and angular information to significantly enhance the information density retained through knowledge distillation. Observing performance disparities in feature distribution between base and novel classes, we propose the Dual Distillation Network (DDNet). This network applies traditional knowledge distillation to base classes and DKD to novel classes, challenging the conventional integration of novel classes with base classes. Additionally, we implement an instance-aware sample selector during inference to dynamically adjust dual branch weights, thereby leveraging the complementary strengths of each approach. Extensive testing on three benchmarks demonstrates that DDNet achieves state-of-the-art results.

In response, we propose Seeker, a multi-agent framework inspired by expert developer strategies for exception handling. Seeker uses agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler to assist LLMs in detecting, capturing, and resolving exceptions more effectively. Our work is the first systematic study on leveraging LLMs to enhance exception handling practices in real development scenarios, providing valuable insights for future improvements in code reliability.",

    "title": "Feather the Throttle: Revisiting Visual Token Pruning for Vision-Language Model Acceleration",
    "summary": "Recent works on accelerating Vision-Language Models show that strong performance can be maintained across a variety of vision-language tasks despite highly compressing visual information. In this work, we examine the popular acceleration approach of early pruning of visual tokens inside the language model and find that its strong performance across many tasks is not due to an exceptional ability to compress visual information, but rather the benchmarks' limited ability to assess fine-grained visual capabilities. Namely, we demonstrate a core issue with the acceleration approach where most tokens towards the top of the image are pruned away. Yet, this issue is only reflected in performance for a small subset of tasks such as localization. For the other evaluated tasks, strong performance is maintained with the flawed pruning strategy. Noting the limited visual capabilities of the studied acceleration technique, we propose FEATHER (Fast and Effective Acceleration wiTH Ensemble cRiteria), a straightforward approach that (1) resolves the identified issue with early-layer pruning, (2) incorporates uniform sampling to ensure coverage across all image regions, and (3) applies pruning in two stages to allow the criteria to become more effective at a later layer while still achieving significant speedup through early-layer pruning. With comparable computational savings, we find that FEATHER has more than 5times performance improvement on the vision-centric localization benchmarks compared to the original acceleration approach.",

    "title": "Proposer-Agent-Evaluator(PAE): Autonomous Skill Discovery For Foundation Model Internet Agents",
    "summary": "The vision of a broadly capable and goal-directed agent, such as an Internet-browsing agent in the digital world and a household humanoid in the physical world, has rapidly advanced, thanks to the generalization capability of foundation models. Such a generalist agent needs to have a large and diverse skill repertoire, such as finding directions between two travel locations and buying specific items from the Internet. If each skill needs to be specified manually through a fixed set of human-annotated instructions, the agent's skill repertoire will necessarily be limited due to the quantity and diversity of human-annotated instructions. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing Proposer-Agent-Evaluator, an effective learning system that enables foundation model agents to autonomously discover and practice skills in the wild. At the heart of PAE is a context-aware task proposer that autonomously proposes tasks for the agent to practice with context information of the environment such as user demos or even just the name of the website itself for Internet-browsing agents. Then, the agent policy attempts those tasks with thoughts and actual grounded operations in the real world with resulting trajectories evaluated by an autonomous VLM-based success evaluator. The success evaluation serves as the reward signal for the agent to refine its policies through RL. We validate PAE on challenging vision-based web navigation, using both real-world and self-hosted websites from WebVoyager and WebArena.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effective learning system to apply autonomous task proposal with RL for agents that generalizes real-world human-annotated benchmarks with SOTA performances.

    "title": "VisDoM: Multi-Document QA with Visually Rich Elements Using Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation",
    "summary": "Understanding information from a collection of multiple documents, particularly those with visually rich elements, is important for document-grounded question answering. This paper introduces VisDoMBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate QA systems in multi-document settings with rich multimodal content, including tables, charts, and presentation slides. We propose VisDoMRAG, a novel multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that simultaneously utilizes visual and textual RAG, combining robust visual retrieval capabilities with sophisticated linguistic reasoning. VisDoMRAG employs a multi-step reasoning process encompassing evidence curation and chain-of-thought reasoning for concurrent textual and visual RAG pipelines. A key novelty of VisDoMRAG is its consistency-constrained modality fusion mechanism, which aligns the reasoning processes across modalities at inference time to produce a coherent final answer. This leads to enhanced accuracy in scenarios where critical information is distributed across modalities and improved answer verifiability through implicit context attribution. Through extensive experiments involving open-source and proprietary large language models, we benchmark state-of-the-art document QA methods on VisDoMBench. Extensive results show that VisDoMRAG outperforms unimodal and long-context LLM baselines for end-to-end multimodal document QA by 12-20%.",

    "title": "When to Speak, When to Abstain: Contrastive Decoding with Abstention",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional performance across diverse tasks by leveraging both pre-trained knowledge (i.e., parametric knowledge) and external knowledge (i.e., contextual knowledge). While substantial efforts have been made to leverage both forms of knowledge, scenarios in which the model lacks any relevant knowledge remain underexplored. Such limitations can result in issues like hallucination, causing reduced reliability and potential risks in high-stakes applications. To address such limitations, this paper extends the task scope to encompass cases where the user's request cannot be fulfilled due to the lack of relevant knowledge. To this end, we introduce Contrastive Decoding with Abstention (CDA), a training-free decoding method that empowers LLMs to generate responses when relevant knowledge is available and to abstain otherwise. CDA evaluates the relevance of each knowledge for a given query, adaptively determining which knowledge to prioritize or which to completely ignore. Extensive experiments with four LLMs on three question-answering datasets demonstrate that CDA can effectively perform accurate generation and abstention simultaneously. These findings highlight CDA's potential to broaden the applicability of LLMs, enhancing reliability and preserving user trust.",

    "title": "MIVE: New Design and Benchmark for Multi-Instance Video Editing",
    "summary": "Recent AI-based video editing has enabled users to edit videos through simple text prompts, significantly simplifying the editing process. However, recent zero-shot video editing techniques primarily focus on global or single-object edits, which can lead to unintended changes in other parts of the video. When multiple objects require localized edits, existing methods face challenges, such as unfaithful editing, editing leakage, and lack of suitable evaluation datasets and metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a zero-shot Multi-Instance Video Editing framework, called MIVE. MIVE is a general-purpose mask-based framework, not dedicated to specific objects (e.g., people). MIVE introduces two key modules: (i) Disentangled Multi-instance Sampling (DMS) to prevent editing leakage and (ii) Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR) to ensure precise localization and faithful editing. Additionally, we present our new MIVE Dataset featuring diverse video scenarios and introduce the Cross-Instance Accuracy (CIA) Score to evaluate editing leakage in multi-instance video editing tasks. Our extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user study evaluations demonstrate that MIVE significantly outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in terms of editing faithfulness, accuracy, and leakage prevention, setting a new benchmark for multi-instance video editing.

    "title": "Emergence of Abstractions: Concept Encoding and Decoding Mechanism for In-Context Learning in Transformers",
    "summary": "Humans distill complex experiences into fundamental abstractions that enable rapid learning and adaptation. Similarly, autoregressive transformers exhibit adaptive learning through in-context learning (ICL), which begs the question of how. In this paper, we propose concept encoding-decoding mechanism to explain ICL by studying how transformers form and use internal abstractions in their representations. On synthetic ICL tasks, we analyze the training dynamics of a small transformer and report the coupled emergence of concept encoding and decoding. As the model learns to encode different latent concepts (e.g., ``Finding the first noun in a sentence.\") into distinct, separable representations, it concureently builds conditional decoding algorithms and improve its ICL performance. We validate the existence of this mechanism across pretrained models of varying scales (Gemma-2 2B/9B/27B, Llama-3.1 8B/70B). Further, through mechanistic interventions and controlled finetuning, we demonstrate that the quality of concept encoding is causally related and predictive of ICL performance. Our empirical insights shed light into better understanding the success and failure modes of large language models via their representations.",

    "summary": "As a typical and practical application of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have gained extensive attention, particularly in vertical domains where LLMs may lack domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we introduce an omnidirectional and automatic RAG benchmark, OmniEval, in the financial domain. Our benchmark is characterized by its multi-dimensional evaluation framework, including (1) a matrix-based RAG scenario evaluation system that categorizes queries into five task classes and 16 financial topics, leading to a structured assessment of diverse query scenarios; (2) a multi-dimensional evaluation data generation approach, which combines GPT-4-based automatic generation and human annotation, achieving an 87.47\\% acceptance ratio in human evaluations on generated instances; (3) a multi-stage evaluation system that evaluates both retrieval and generation performance, result in a comprehensive evaluation on the RAG pipeline; and (4) robust evaluation metrics derived from rule-based and LLM-based ones, enhancing the reliability of assessments through manual annotations and supervised fine-tuning of an LLM evaluator. Our experiments demonstrate the comprehensiveness of OmniEval, which includes extensive test datasets and highlights the performance variations of RAG systems across diverse topics and tasks, revealing significant opportunities for RAG models to improve their capabilities in vertical domains.

    "title": "Multi-Dimensional Insights: Benchmarking Real-World Personalization in Large Multimodal Models",
    "summary": "The rapidly developing field of large multimodal models (LMMs) has led to the emergence of diverse models with remarkable capabilities. However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively, objectively and accurately evaluate whether LMMs align with the diverse needs of humans in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose the Multi-Dimensional Insights (MDI) benchmark, which includes over 500 images covering six common scenarios of human life. Notably, the MDI-Benchmark offers two significant advantages over existing evaluations: (1) Each image is accompanied by two types of questions: simple questions to assess the model's understanding of the image, and complex questions to evaluate the model's ability to analyze and reason beyond basic content. (2) Recognizing that people of different age groups have varying needs and perspectives when faced with the same scenario, our benchmark stratifies questions into three age categories: young people, middle-aged people, and older people. This design allows for a detailed assessment of LMMs' capabilities in meeting the preferences and needs of different age groups. With MDI-Benchmark, the strong model like GPT-4o achieve 79% accuracy on age-related tasks, indicating that existing LMMs still have considerable room for improvement in addressing real-world applications. Looking ahead, we anticipate that the MDI-Benchmark will open new pathways for aligning real-world personalization in LMMs. The MDI-Benchmark data and evaluation code are available at https://mdi-benchmark.github.io/",

    "title": "Are Your LLMs Capable of Stable Reasoning?",
    "summary": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable progress in complex reasoning tasks. However, a significant discrepancy persists between benchmark performances and real-world applications. We identify this gap as primarily stemming from current evaluation protocols and metrics, which inadequately capture the full spectrum of LLM capabilities, particularly in complex reasoning tasks where both accuracy and consistency are crucial. This work makes two key contributions. First, we introduce G-Pass@k, a novel evaluation metric that provides a continuous assessment of model performance across multiple sampling attempts, quantifying both the model's peak performance potential and its stability. Second, we present LiveMathBench, a dynamic benchmark comprising challenging, contemporary mathematical problems designed to minimize data leakage risks during evaluation. Through extensive experiments using G-Pass@k on state-of-the-art LLMs with LiveMathBench, we provide comprehensive insights into both their maximum capabilities and operational consistency. Our findings reveal substantial room for improvement in LLMs' \"realistic\" reasoning capabilities, highlighting the need for more robust evaluation methods.
