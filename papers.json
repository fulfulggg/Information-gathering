    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13183v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Dynamic urban environments, characterized by moving cameras and objects, pose significant challenges for camera trajectory estimation by complicating the distinction between camera-induced and object motion. We introduce MONA, a novel framework designed for robust moving object detection and segmentation from videos shot by dynamic cameras. MONA comprises two key modules: Dynamic Points Extraction, which leverages optical flow and tracking any point to identify dynamic points, and Moving Object Segmentation, which employs adaptive bounding box filtering, and the Segment Anything for precise moving object segmentation. We validate MONA by integrating with the camera trajectory estimation method LEAP-VO, and it achieves state-of-the-art results on the MPI Sintel dataset comparing to existing methods. These results demonstrate MONA's effectiveness for moving object detection and its potential in many other applications in the urban planning field.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13277v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Computed tomography (CT) and clinical numeric data are essential modalities for cancer evaluation, but building large-scale multimodal training datasets for developing medical foundation models remains challenging due to the structural complexity of multi-slice CT data and high cost of expert annotation. In this study, we propose MEDFORM, a multimodal pre-training strategy that guides CT image representation learning using complementary information from clinical data for medical foundation model development. MEDFORM efficiently processes CT slice through multiple instance learning (MIL) and adopts a dual pre-training strategy: first pretraining the CT slice feature extractor using SimCLR-based self-supervised learning, then aligning CT and clinical modalities through cross-modal contrastive learning. Our model was pre-trained on three different cancer types: lung cancer (141,171 slices), breast cancer (8,100 slices), colorectal cancer (10,393 slices). The experimental results demonstrated that this dual pre-training strategy improves cancer classification performance and maintains robust performance in few-shot learning scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13307v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) aims to match individuals across different camera modalities, a critical task in modern surveillance systems. While current VI-ReID methods focus on cross-modality matching, real-world applications often involve mixed galleries containing both V and I images, where state-of-the-art methods show significant performance limitations due to large domain shifts and low discrimination across mixed modalities. This is because gallery images from the same modality may have lower domain gaps but correspond to different identities. This paper introduces a novel mixed-modal ReID setting, where galleries contain data from both modalities. To address the domain shift among inter-modal and low discrimination capacity in intra-modal matching, we propose the Mixed Modality-Erased and -Related (MixER) method. The MixER learning approach disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared identity information through orthogonal decomposition, modality-confusion, and ID-modality-related objectives. MixER enhances feature robustness across modalities, improving cross-modal and mixed-modal settings performance. Our extensive experiments on the SYSU-MM01, RegDB and LLMC datasets indicate that our approach can provide state-of-the-art results using a single backbone, and showcase the flexibility of our approach in mixed gallery applications.",

Motion blur is prevalent in real-world dynamic video capture, especially due to human movements in 3D human avatar modeling. Existing methods either (1) assume sharp image inputs, failing to address the detail loss introduced by motion blur, or (2) mainly consider blur by camera movements, neglecting the human motion blur which is more common in animatable avatars. Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Deblur-Avatar significantly outperforms existing methods in rendering quality and quantitative metrics, producing sharp avatar reconstructions and enabling real-time rendering under challenging motion blur conditions.",

However, adversarial training necessitates additional training, while adversarial purification suffers from low time efficiency. More critically, current defenses are designed under the perturbation-based adversarial threat model, which is ineffective against the recently proposed unrestricted adversarial attacks. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient adversarial defense method that counters both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks. Our defense is inspired by the observation that adversarial attacks are typically located near the decision boundary and are sensitive to pixel changes. To address this, we introduce adversarial anti-aliasing to mitigate adversarial modifications. Additionally, we propose adversarial super-resolution, which leverages prior knowledge from clean datasets to benignly recover images. These approaches do not require additional training and are computationally efficient without calculating gradients. Extensive experiments against both perturbation-based and unrestricted adversarial attacks demonstrate that our defense method outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial purification methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13340v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable generation capability. However, their training generally requires huge computational resources and large-scale datasets. To solve these, recent studies empower DMs with the advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique and propose retrieval-augmented diffusion models (RDMs). By incorporating rich knowledge from an auxiliary database, RAG enhances diffusion models' generation and generalization ability while significantly reducing model parameters. Despite the great success, RAG may introduce novel security issues that warrant further investigation. In this paper, we reveal that the RDM is susceptible to backdoor attacks by proposing a multimodal contrastive attack approach named BadRDM. Our framework fully considers RAG's characteristics and is devised to manipulate the retrieved items for given text triggers, thereby further controlling the generated contents. Specifically, we first insert a tiny portion of images into the retrieval database as target toxicity surrogates. Subsequently, a malicious variant of contrastive learning is adopted to inject backdoors into the retriever, which builds shortcuts from triggers to the toxicity surrogates. Furthermore, we enhance the attacks through novel entropy-based selection and generative augmentation strategies that can derive better toxicity surrogates. Extensive experiments on two mainstream tasks demonstrate the proposed BadRDM achieves outstanding attack effects while preserving the model's benign utility.",

Previous image classification methods primarily modify model architectures or add features, and they optimize models using cross-entropy loss on class logits. Since they focus on classifying images with considering class labels, these methods may struggle to learn various \\emph{aspects} of classes (e.g., natural positions and shape changes). Rethinking the previous approach from a novel view, we propose a multi-aspect knowledge distillation method using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Our approach involves: 1) querying Large Language Model with multi-aspect questions relevant to the knowledge we want to transfer to the model, 2) extracting corresponding logits from MLLM, and 3) expanding the model's output dimensions to distill these multi-aspect logits. We then apply cross-entropy loss to class logits and binary cross-entropy loss to multi-aspect logits. Through our method, the model can learn not only the knowledge about visual aspects but also the abstract and complex aspects that require a deeper understanding. We primarily apply our method to image classification, and to explore the potential for extending our model, we expand it to other tasks, such as object detection. In all experimental results, our method improves the performance of the baselines. Additionally, we analyze the effect of multi-aspect knowledge distillation. These results demonstrate that our method can transfer knowledge about various aspects to the model and the aspect knowledge can enhance model performance in computer vision tasks. This paper demonstrates the great potential of multi-aspect knowledge distillation, and we believe it offers a promising direction for future research in computer vision and beyond.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13349v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable progress in visual content generation. However, traditional diffusion models directly denoise the entire image from noisy inputs, disregarding the hierarchical structure present in visual signals. This method is computationally intensive, especially for high-resolution image generation. Signal processing often leverages hierarchical decompositions; for instance, Fourier analysis decomposes signals by frequency, while wavelet analysis captures localized frequency components, reflecting both spatial and frequency information simultaneously. Inspired by these principles, we propose a multiscale diffusion framework that generates hierarchical visual representations, which are subsequently integrated to form the final output. The diffusion model target, whether raw RGB pixels or latent features from a Variational Autoencoder, s divided into multiple components that each capture distinct spatial levels. The low-resolution component contains the primary informative signal, while higher-resolution components add high-frequency details, such as texture. This approach divides image generation into two stages: producing a low-resolution base signal, followed by a high-resolution residual signal. Both stages can be effectively modeled using simpler, lightweight transformer architectures compared to full-resolution generation. This decomposition is conceptually similar to wavelet decomposition but offers a more streamlined and intuitive design. Our method, termed MSF(short for Multi-Scale Factorization), achieves an FID of 2.2 and an IS of 255.4 on the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, reducing computational costs by 50% compared to baseline methods.",

However, their quadratic computational complexity necessitates the use of window-based attention mechanisms, which restricts the receptive field and limits effective context expansion. Recently, the Mamba architecture has emerged as a promising alternative with linear computational complexity, allowing it to avoid window mechanisms and maintain a large receptive field. Nevertheless, Mamba faces challenges in handling long-context dependencies when high pixel-level precision is required, as in SR tasks. This is due to its hidden state mechanism, which can compress and store a substantial amount of context but only in an approximate manner, leading to inaccuracies that transformers do not suffer from. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{Contrast}, a hybrid SR model that combines \\textbf{Con}volutional, \\textbf{Tra}nsformer, and \\textbf{St}ate Space components, effectively blending the strengths of transformers and Mamba to address their individual limitations. By integrating transformer and state space mechanisms, \\textbf{Contrast} compensates for the shortcomings of each approach, enhancing both global context modeling and pixel-level accuracy. We demonstrate that combining these two architectures allows us to mitigate the problems inherent in each, resulting in improved performance on image super-resolution tasks.",

This paper introduces NUDT4MSTAR, a large-scale SAR dataset for vehicle target recognition in the wild, including 40 target types and a wide array of imaging conditions across 5 different scenes. NUDT4MSTAR represents a significant leap forward in dataset scale, containing over 190,000 images-tenfold the size of its predecessors. To enhance the utility of this dataset, we meticulously annotate each image with detailed target information and imaging conditions. We also provide data in both processed magnitude images and original complex formats. Then, we construct a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 7 experiments with 15 recognition methods focusing on the stable and effective ATR issues. Besides, we conduct transfer learning experiments utilizing various models trained on NUDT4MSTAR and applied to three other target datasets, thereby demonstrating its substantial potential to the broader field of ground objects ATR. Finally, we discuss this dataset's application value and ATR's significant challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this work marks the first-ever endeavor to create a large-scale dataset benchmark for fine-grained SAR recognition in the wild, featuring an extensive collection of exhaustively annotated vehicle images.

However, this method still falls short of fully exploiting the potential of feature extractors, as selectors only operate on highly compressed feature maps that lack diversity and suffer from substantial information loss. Additionally, while union training can improve perceptual quality, the highest evaluation scores are typically obtained without it, creating a trade-off between quantitative accuracy and perceptual fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose an enhanced E-S architecture, which utilizes richer, less-loss feature representations and incorporates auxiliary features during the selection process, thereby improving the effectiveness of the feature selection mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a novel loss function, the Symmetrization Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (SWBCE), which simultaneously emphasizes both the recall of edge pixels and the suppression of erroneous edge predictions, thereby enhancing the predictions both in the perceptual quality and the prediction accuracy. The effectiveness and superiority of our approaches over baseline models, the standard E-S framework, and the standard Weight Binary Cross-Entropy (WBCE) loss function are demonstrated by extensive experiments. For example, our enhanced E-S architecture trained with SWBCE loss function achieves average improvements of 8.25$\\%$, 8.01$\\%$, and 33.25$\\%$ in ODS, OIS, and AP, measured on BIPED2 compared with the baseline models, significantly outperforming the standard E-S method.

To bridge this gap, we propose the Meta-Feature Adapter (MFA), a lightweight module designed to integrate environmental metadata into vision-language foundation models, such as CLIP, to enhance Animal ReID performance. Our approach translates environmental metadata into natural language descriptions, encodes them into metadata-aware text embeddings, and incorporates these embeddings into image features through a cross-attention mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce a Gated Cross-Attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the weights of metadata contributions, further improving performance.

Recognizing the human visual system (HVS) as the decision-maker in quality assessment regardless of media types, we can emulate the evaluation criteria for human perception via neural networks and further transfer the capability of quality prediction from images to point clouds by leveraging the prior knowledge in the images. Specifically, domain adaptation (DA) can be leveraged to bridge the images and point clouds by aligning feature distributions of the two media in the same feature space. However, the different manifestations of distortions in images and point clouds make feature alignment a difficult task. To reduce the alignment difficulty and consider the different distortion distribution during alignment, we have derived formulas to decompose the optimization objective of the conventional DA into two suboptimization functions with distortion as a transition. Specifically, through network implementation, we propose the distortion-guided biased feature alignment which integrates existing/estimated distortion distribution into the adversarial DA framework, emphasizing common distortion patterns during feature alignment. Besides, we propose the quality-aware feature disentanglement to mitigate the destruction of the mapping from features to quality during alignment with biased distortions.

Contrastive learning, a widely adopted technique for enhancing feature quality, leverages sample relations to extract intrinsic features that capture semantic information and has achieved remarkable success in Few-Shot Learning (FSL). Nevertheless, current few-shot contrastive learning approaches often overlook the semantic similarity discrepancies at different granularities when employing the same modeling approach for different sample relations, which limits the potential of few-shot contrastive learning. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective contrastive learning approach, Multi-Grained Relation Contrastive Learning (MGRCL), as a pre-training feature learning model to boost few-shot learning by meticulously modeling sample relations at different granularities. MGRCL categorizes sample relations into three types: intra-sample relation of the same sample under different transformations, intra-class relation of homogenous samples, and inter-class relation of inhomogeneous samples. In MGRCL, we design Transformation Consistency Learning (TCL) to ensure the rigorous semantic consistency of a sample under different transformations by aligning predictions of input pairs. Furthermore, to preserve discriminative information, we employ Class Contrastive Learning (CCL) to ensure that a sample is always closer to its homogenous samples than its inhomogeneous ones, as homogenous samples share similar semantic content while inhomogeneous samples have different semantic content.

Therefore, we study how to use various loss functions from historical research orthogonally to train a new state-of-the-art face recognition model based on large vision models, called LVFace.

While these approaches effectively detect partial obstructions and adapt to varying lighting conditions, their performance significantly diminishes when haze is present. This paper proposes a novel hybrid model with a pre-trained feature extractor and a Pinball Generalized Twin Support Vector Machine (Pin-GTSVM) classifier, which removes the need for a dehazing system from the current State-of-The-Art hazy parking slot classification systems and is also insensitive to any atmospheric noise. The proposed system can seamlessly integrate with conventional smart parking infrastructures, leveraging a minimal number of cameras to monitor and manage hundreds of parking spaces efficiently. Its effectiveness has been evaluated against established parking space detection methods using the CNRPark Patches, PKLot, and a custom dataset specific to hazy parking scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13426v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Weakly supervised landslide extraction aims to identify landslide regions from remote sensing data using models trained with weak labels, particularly image-level labels. However, it is often challenged by the imprecise boundaries of the extracted objects due to the lack of pixel-wise supervision and the properties of landslide objects. To tackle these issues, we propose a simple yet effective method by auto-prompting the Segment Anything Model (SAM), i.e., APSAM. Instead of depending on high-quality class activation maps (CAMs) for pseudo-labeling or fine-tuning SAM, our method directly yields fine-grained segmentation masks from SAM inference through prompt engineering. Specifically, it adaptively generates hybrid prompts from the CAMs obtained by an object localization network. To provide sufficient information for SAM prompting, an adaptive prompt generation (APG) algorithm is designed to fully leverage the visual patterns of CAMs, enabling the efficient generation of pseudo-masks for landslide extraction. These informative prompts are able to identify the extent of landslide areas (box prompts) and denote the centers of landslide objects (point prompts), guiding SAM in landslide segmentation. Experimental results on high-resolution aerial and satellite datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving improvements of at least 3.0\\% in F1 score and 3.69\\% in IoU compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

To address these challenges, we propose the global context consistency flow (GC-ConsFlow), a novel dual-stream framework that effectively integrates spatial and temporal features for robust Deepfake detection. The global grouped context aggregation module (GGCA), integrated into the global context-aware frame flow stream (GCAF), enhances spatial feature extraction by aggregating grouped global context information, enabling the detection of subtle, spatial artifacts within frames. The flow-gradient temporal consistency stream (FGTC), rather than directly modeling the residuals, it is used to improve the robustness of temporal feature extraction against the inconsistency introduced by unnatural facial motion using optical flow residuals and gradient-based features.

In this approach, we integrate pre-training, pruning, and fine-tuning into a single training cycle, referred to as the `one cycle approach'. The core idea is to search for the optimal sub-network during the early stages of network training, guided by norm-based group saliency criteria and structured sparsity regularization. We introduce a novel pruning indicator that determines the stable pruning epoch by assessing the similarity between evolving pruning sub-networks across consecutive training epochs. Also, group sparsity regularization helps to accelerate the pruning process and results in speeding up the entire process.

Existing methods for detecting AI-generated images primarily focus on specific forgery clues, which are often tailored to particular generative models like GANs or diffusion models.

Building on the observation that generative images often exhibit local anomalies, such as excessive smoothness, blurred textures, and unnatural pixel variations in small regions, we propose the localized discrepancy representation network (LDR-Net), a novel approach for detecting AI-generated images. LDR-Net captures smoothing artifacts and texture irregularities, which are common but often overlooked. It integrates two complementary modules: local gradient autocorrelation (LGA) which models local smoothing anomalies to detect smoothing anomalies, and local variation pattern (LVP) which captures unnatural regularities by modeling the complexity of image patterns. By merging LGA and LVP features, a comprehensive representation of localized discrepancies can be provided. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our LDR-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting generated images and exhibits satisfactory generalization across unseen generative models.

However, recent research in the SNN domain has mainly focused on enhancing accuracy by designing large-scale Transformer structures, which typically rely on substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained devices. To overcome this challenge, we propose a quantized spike-driven Transformer baseline (QSD-Transformer), which achieves reduced resource demands by utilizing a low bit-width parameter. Regrettably, the QSD-Transformer often suffers from severe performance degradation. In this paper, we first conduct empirical analysis and find that the bimodal distribution of quantized spike-driven self-attention (Q-SDSA) leads to spike information distortion (SID) during quantization, causing significant performance degradation. To mitigate this issue, we take inspiration from mutual information entropy and propose a bi-level optimization strategy to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. Specifically, at the lower level, we introduce an information-enhanced LIF to rectify the information distribution in Q-SDSA. At the upper level, we propose a fine-grained distillation scheme for the QSD-Transformer to align the distribution in Q-SDSA with that in the counterpart ANN. By integrating the bi-level optimization strategy, the QSD-Transformer can attain enhanced energy efficiency without sacrificing its high-performance advantage.For instance, when compared to the prior SNN benchmark on ImageNet, the QSD-Transformer achieves 80.3\\% top-1 accuracy, accompanied by significant reductions of 6.0$\\times$ and 8.1$\\times$ in power consumption and model size, respectively.

This scenario is particularly relevant in real-world applications where data privacy, storage limitations, or labeling costs are significant concerns. Key challenges in SFADA include selecting the most informative samples from the target domain for labeling, effectively leveraging both labeled and unlabeled target data, and adapting the model without relying on source domain information. Additionally, existing methods often struggle with noisy or outlier samples and may require impractical progressive labeling during training. To effectively select more informative samples without frequently requesting human annotations, we propose the Propensity-driven Uncertainty Learning (ProULearn) framework. ProULearn utilizes a novel homogeneity propensity estimation mechanism combined with correlation index calculation to evaluate feature-level relationships. This approach enables the identification of representative and challenging samples while avoiding noisy outliers. Additionally, we develop a central correlation loss to refine pseudo-labels and create compact class distributions during adaptation. In this way, ProULearn effectively bridges the domain gap and maximizes adaptation performance.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13563v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced autonomous driving (AD) by enhancing reasoning capabilities; however, these models remain highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. While existing research has explored white-box attacks to some extent, the more practical and challenging black-box scenarios remain largely underexplored due to their inherent difficulty. In this paper, we take the first step toward designing black-box adversarial attacks specifically targeting VLMs in AD. We identify two key challenges for achieving effective black-box attacks in this context: the effectiveness across driving reasoning chains in AD systems and the dynamic nature of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose Cascading Adversarial Disruption (CAD). It first introduces Decision Chain Disruption, which targets low-level reasoning breakdown by generating and injecting deceptive semantics, ensuring the perturbations remain effective across the entire decision-making chain. Building on this, we present Risky Scene Induction, which addresses dynamic adaptation by leveraging a surrogate VLM to understand and construct high-level risky scenarios that are likely to result in critical errors in the current driving contexts. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple AD VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that CAD achieves state-of-the-art attack effectiveness, significantly outperforming existing methods (+13.43% on average). Moreover, we validate its practical applicability through real-world attacks on AD vehicles powered by VLMs, where the route completion rate drops by 61.11% and the vehicle crashes directly into the obstacle vehicle with adversarial patches. Finally, we release CADA dataset, comprising 18,808 adversarial visual-question-answer pairs, to facilitate further evaluation and research in this critical domain. Our codes and dataset will be available after paper's acceptance.",

In this work, we assess the performance of VLMs on the challenging Bongard Openworld Problems benchmark, which involves reasoning over natural images. We propose and evaluate three human-inspired paradigms: holistic analysis (global context processing), deductive rule learning (explicit rule derivation and application), and componential analysis (structured decomposition of images into components). Our results demonstrate that state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4o and Gemini, not only surpass human benchmarks but also excel in structured reasoning tasks, with componential analysis proving especially effective. However, ablation studies reveal key challenges, such as handling synthetic images, making fine-grained distinctions, and interpreting nuanced contextual information. These insights underscore the need for further advancements in model robustness and generalization, while highlighting the transformative potential of structured reasoning approaches in enhancing VLM capabilities.",

Given the computational cost of deploying SSMs on resource-limited edge devices, Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is a technique with the potential for efficient deployment of SSMs. In this work, we propose QMamba, one of the first PTQ frameworks to our knowledge, designed for vision SSMs based on the analysis of the activation distributions in SSMs. We reveal that the distribution of discrete parameters exhibits long-tailed skewness and the distribution of the hidden state sequence exhibits highly dynamic variations. Correspondingly, we design Long-tailed Skewness Quantization (LtSQ) to quantize discrete parameters and Temporal Group Quantization (TGQ) to quantize hidden states, which reduces the quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QMamba outperforms advanced PTQ methods on vision models across multiple model sizes and architectures.

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown great effectiveness across various video segmentation tasks. However, its application to offline RVOS is challenged by the translation of the text into effective prompts and a lack of global context awareness. In this paper, we propose a novel RVOS framework, termed MPG-SAM 2, to address these challenges. Specifically, MPG-SAM 2 employs a unified multimodal encoder to jointly encode video and textual features, generating semantically aligned video and text embeddings, along with multimodal class tokens. A mask prior generator utilizes the video embeddings and class tokens to create pseudo masks of target objects and global context. These masks are fed into the prompt encoder as dense prompts along with multimodal class tokens as sparse prompts to generate accurate prompts for SAM 2. To provide the online SAM 2 with a global view, we introduce a hierarchical global-historical aggregator, which allows SAM 2 to aggregate global and historical information of target objects at both pixel and object levels, enhancing the target representation and temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on several RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MPG-SAM 2 and the effectiveness of our proposed modules.",

To address the deficiency, we propose EventVL, the first generative event-based MLLM (Multimodal Large Language Model) framework for explicit semantic understanding. Specifically, to bridge the data gap for connecting different modalities semantics, we first annotate a large event-image/video-text dataset, containing almost 1.4 million high-quality pairs of data, which enables effective learning across various scenes, e.g., drive scene or human motion. After that, we design Event Spatiotemporal Representation to fully explore the comprehensive information by diversely aggregating and segmenting the event stream. To further promote a compact semantic space, Dynamic Semantic Alignment is introduced to improve and complete sparse semantic spaces of events. Extensive experiments show that our EventVL can significantly surpass existing MLLM baselines in event captioning and scene description generation tasks.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13709v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: I introduce two novel loss functions for classification in deep learning. The two loss functions extend standard cross entropy loss by regularizing it with minimum entropy and Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence terms. The first of the two novel loss functions is termed mixed entropy loss (MIX-ENT for short), while the second one is termed minimum entropy regularized cross-entropy loss (MIN-ENT for short). The MIX-ENT function introduces a regularizer that can be shown to be equivalent to the sum of a minimum entropy term and a K-L divergence term. However, it should be noted that the K-L divergence term here is different from that in the standard cross-entropy loss function, in the sense that it swaps the roles of the target probability and the hypothesis probability. The MIN-ENT function simply adds a minimum entropy regularizer to the standard cross entropy loss function. In both MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT, the minimum entropy regularizer minimizes the entropy of the hypothesis probability distribution which is output by the neural network. Experiments on the EMNIST-Letters dataset shows that my implementation of MIX-ENT and MIN-ENT lets the VGG model climb from its previous 3rd position on the paperswithcode leaderboard to reach the 2nd position on the leaderboard, outperforming the Spinal-VGG model in so doing. Specifically, using standard cross-entropy, VGG achieves 95.86% while Spinal-VGG achieves 95.88% classification accuracies, whereas using VGG (without Spinal-VGG) our MIN-ENT achieved 95.933%, while our MIX-ENT achieved 95.927% accuracies.

However, many of these methods remain computationally expensive for spacecraft processors and prevent real-time operation. Training of such algorithms is additionally complex due to the scarcity of labeled data and reliance on supervised learning approaches. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) offers a promising solution by facilitating model training with disparate data sources such as simulations or synthetic scenes, although UDA is difficult to apply to celestial environments where challenging feature spaces are paramount. To alleviate such issues, You Only Crash Once (YOCOv1) has studied the integration of Visual Similarity-based Alignment (VSA) into lightweight one-stage object detection architectures to improve space terrain UDA. Although proven effective, the approach faces notable limitations, including performance degradations in multi-class and high-altitude scenarios. Building upon the foundation of YOCOv1, we propose novel additions to the VSA scheme that enhance terrain detection capabilities under UDA, and our approach is evaluated across both simulated and real-world data. Our second YOCO rendition, YOCOv2, is capable of achieving state-of-the-art UDA performance on surface terrain detection, where we showcase improvements upwards of 31% compared with YOCOv1 and terrestrial state-of-the-art.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13756v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In real-world data, long-tailed data distribution is common, making it challenging for models trained on empirical risk minimisation to learn and classify tail classes effectively. While many studies have sought to improve long tail recognition by altering the data distribution in the feature space and adjusting model decision boundaries, research on the synergy and corrective approach among various methods is limited. Our study delves into three long-tail recognition techniques: Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCL), Rare-Class Sample Generator (RSG), and Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss (LDAM). SCL enhances intra-class clusters based on feature similarity and promotes clear inter-class separability but tends to favour dominant classes only. When RSG is integrated into the model, we observed that the intra-class features further cluster towards the class centre, which demonstrates a synergistic effect together with SCL's principle of enhancing intra-class clustering. RSG generates new tail features and compensates for the tail feature space squeezed by SCL. Similarly, LDAM is known to introduce a larger margin specifically for tail classes; we demonstrate that LDAM further bolsters the model's performance on tail classes when combined with the more explicit decision boundaries achieved by SCL and RSG. Furthermore, SCL can compensate for the dominant class accuracy sacrificed by RSG and LDAM. Our research emphasises the synergy and balance among the three techniques, with each amplifying the strengths of the others and mitigating their shortcomings. Our experiment on long-tailed distribution datasets, using an end-to-end architecture, yields competitive results by enhancing tail class accuracy without compromising dominant class performance, achieving a balanced improvement across all classes.",

Large quantities of recyclable materials are lost to coarse waste, so more effective sorting processes must be developed to recover them. Two key aspects to automate the sorting process are object detection with material classification in mixed piles of waste, and autonomous control of hydraulic machinery. Because most objects in those accumulations of waste are damaged or destroyed, object detection alone is not feasible in the majority of cases. To address these challenges, we propose a classification of materials with multispectral images of ultraviolet (UV), visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectrums. Solution for autonomous control of hydraulic heavy machines for sorting of bulky waste is being investigated using cost-effective cameras and artificial intelligence-based controllers.",

    "title": "Dual-Modal Prototype Joint Learning for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning",
    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13859v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel compositions of attributes and objects by leveraging knowledge learned from seen compositions. Recent approaches have explored the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to align textual and visual modalities. These methods typically employ prompt engineering, parameter-tuning, and modality fusion to generate rich textual prototypes that serve as class prototypes for CZSL. However, the modality gap results in textual prototypes being unable to fully capture the optimal representations of all class prototypes, particularly those with fine-grained features, which can be directly obtained from the visual modality. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Modal Prototype Joint Learning framework for the CZSL task. Our approach, based on VLMs, introduces prototypes in both the textual and visual modalities. The textual prototype is optimized to capture broad conceptual information, aiding the model's generalization across unseen compositions. Meanwhile, the visual prototype is used to mitigate the classification errors caused by the modality gap and capture fine-grained details to distinguish images with similar appearances. To effectively optimize these prototypes, we design specialized decomposition modules and a joint learning strategy that enrich the features from both modalities. These prototypes not only capture key category information during training but also serve as crucial reference targets during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in the closed-world setting and competitive performance in the open-world setting across three publicly available CZSL benchmarks. These findings validate the effectiveness of our method in advancing compositional generalization.",

These geometrically rendered images serve as visual prompts for a diffusion-based Edge-to-Image translation model, which generates corresponding mated samples. The resulting novel synthetic identities are then used to train a forehead-crease verification network. To enhance intra-subject diversity in the generated samples, we employ two strategies: (a) perturbing the control points of B-splines under defined constraints to maintain label consistency, and (b) applying image-level augmentations to the geometric visual prompts, such as dropout and elastic transformations, specifically tailored to crease patterns. By integrating the proposed synthetic dataset with real-world data, our method significantly improves the performance of forehead-crease verification systems under a cross-database verification protocol.",

This approach results in 167,254 detailed captions, with an average of 22.94 words per caption.

To benchmark this task, we design a robust baseline based on X-Decoder. The experimental results demonstrate that Pix2Cap-COCO is a particularly challenging dataset, as it requires models to excel in both fine-grained visual understanding and detailed language generation. Furthermore, we leverage Pix2Cap-COCO for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on large multimodal models (LMMs) to enhance their performance. For example, training with Pix2Cap-COCO significantly improves the performance of GPT4RoI, yielding gains in CIDEr +1.4%, ROUGE +0.4%, and SPICE +0.5% on Visual Genome dataset, and strengthens its region understanding ability on the ViP-BENCH, with an overall improvement of +5.1%, including notable increases in recognition accuracy +11.2% and language generation quality +22.2%.",

In this paper, we propose PointOBB-v3, a stronger single point-supervised OOD framework. Compared to existing methods, it generates pseudo rotated boxes without additional priors and incorporates support for the end-to-end paradigm. PointOBB-v3 functions by integrating three unique image views: the original view, a resized view, and a rotated/flipped (rot/flp) view. Based on the views, a scale augmentation module and an angle acquisition module are constructed. In the first module, a Scale-Sensitive Consistency (SSC) loss and a Scale-Sensitive Feature Fusion (SSFF) module are introduced to improve the model's ability to estimate object scale. To achieve precise angle predictions, the second module employs symmetry-based self-supervised learning. Additionally, we introduce an end-to-end version that eliminates the pseudo-label generation process by integrating a detector branch and introduces an Instance-Aware Weighting (IAW) strategy to focus on high-quality predictions. We conducted extensive experiments on the DIOR-R, DOTA-v1.0/v1.5/v2.0, FAIR1M, STAR, and RSAR datasets.

BDPM addresses this by decomposing images into bitplanes and employing XOR-based noise transformations, with a denoising model trained using binary cross-entropy loss. This approach enables precise noise control and computationally efficient inference, significantly lowering computational costs and improving model convergence. When evaluated on image restoration tasks such as image super-resolution, inpainting, and blind image restoration, BDPM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FFHQ, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ datasets.

We then introduce VideoReward, a multi-dimensional video reward model, and examine how annotations and various design choices impact its rewarding efficacy. From a unified reinforcement learning perspective aimed at maximizing reward with KL regularization, we introduce three alignment algorithms for flow-based models by extending those from diffusion models. These include two training-time strategies: direct preference optimization for flow (Flow-DPO) and reward weighted regression for flow (Flow-RWR), and an inference-time technique, Flow-NRG, which applies reward guidance directly to noisy videos. Experimental results indicate that VideoReward significantly outperforms existing reward models, and Flow-DPO demonstrates superior performance compared to both Flow-RWR and standard supervised fine-tuning methods.

To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

Open-set test-time adaptation (OSTTA) aims to adapt a source pre-trained model online to an unlabeled target domain that contains unknown classes. This task becomes more challenging when multiple modalities are involved. Existing methods have primarily focused on unimodal OSTTA, often filtering out low-confidence samples without addressing the complexities of multimodal data. In this work, we present Adaptive Entropy-aware Optimization (AEO), a novel framework specifically designed to tackle Multimodal Open-set Test-time Adaptation (MM-OSTTA) for the first time. Our analysis shows that the entropy difference between known and unknown samples in the target domain strongly correlates with MM-OSTTA performance. To leverage this, we propose two key components: Unknown-aware Adaptive Entropy Optimization (UAE) and Adaptive Modality Prediction Discrepancy Optimization (AMP). These components enhance the ability of model to distinguish unknown class samples during online adaptation by amplifying the entropy difference between known and unknown samples. To thoroughly evaluate our proposed methods in the MM-OSTTA setting, we establish a new benchmark derived from existing datasets. This benchmark includes two downstream tasks and incorporates five modalities. Extensive experiments across various domain shift situations demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the AEO framework.

However, the benefits of such representation in LMMs are limited to the natural image domain, and these models perform poorly for remote sensing (RS). The distinct overhead viewpoint, scale variation, and presence of small objects in high-resolution RS imagery present a unique challenge in region-level comprehension. Moreover, the development of the grounding conversation capability of LMMs within RS is hindered by the lack of granular, RS domain-specific grounded data. Addressing these limitations, we propose GeoPixel - the first end-to-end high resolution RS-LMM that supports pixel-level grounding. This capability allows fine-grained visual perception by generating interleaved masks in conversation. GeoPixel supports up to 4K HD resolution in any aspect ratio, ideal for high-precision RS image analysis. To support the grounded conversation generation (GCG) in RS imagery, we curate a visually grounded dataset GeoPixelD through a semi-automated pipeline that utilizes set-of-marks prompting and spatial priors tailored for RS data to methodically control the data generation process. GeoPixel demonstrates superior performance in pixel-level comprehension, surpassing existing LMMs in both single-target and multi-target segmentation tasks.

In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation.

Both are designed to solve complex classification tasks but from different perspectives. This study demonstrates that CNNs and ViT architectures stem from a unified underlying learning mechanism, which quantitatively measures the single-nodal performance (SNP) of each node in feedforward (FF) and multi-head attention (MHA) subblocks. Each node identifies small clusters of possible output labels, with additional noise represented as labels outside these clusters. These features are progressively sharpened along the transformer encoders, enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio. This unified underlying learning mechanism leads to two main findings. First, it enables an efficient applied nodal diagonal connection (ANDC) pruning technique without affecting the accuracy. Second, based on the SNP, spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs among the MHA heads, such that each head focuses its attention on a subset of labels through cooperation among its SNPs. Consequently, each head becomes an expert in recognizing its designated labels, representing a quantitative MHA modus vivendi mechanism. These results are based on a compact convolutional transformer architecture trained on the CIFAR-100 and Flowers-102 datasets and call for their extension to other architectures and applications, such as natural language processing.",

Aided by recent breakthroughs in generative technologies, this work enables robot teams to act beyond what is currently known about the environment by inferring a distribution of reasonable interpretations of the scene. We developed a map predictor that inpaints the unknown space in a multi-agent 2D occupancy map during an exploration mission. From a comparison of several inpainting methods, we found that a fine-tuned latent diffusion inpainting model could provide rich and coherent interpretations of simulated urban environments with relatively little computation time. By iteratively inferring interpretations of the scene throughout an exploration run, we are able to identify areas that exhibit high uncertainty in the prediction, which we formalize with the concept of generative entropy. We prioritize tasks in regions of high generative entropy, hypothesizing that this will expedite convergence on an accurate predicted map of the scene. In our study we juxtapose this new paradigm of task ranking with the state of the art, which ranks regions to explore by those which maximize expected information recovery. We compare both of these methods in a simulated urban environment with three vehicles.

This work addresses this gap by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques at improving model performance across a wide range of ultrasound image analysis tasks. To achieve this, we introduce a new standardized benchmark of 14 ultrasound image classification and semantic segmentation tasks from 10 different sources and covering 11 body regions. Our results demonstrate that many of the augmentations commonly used for tasks on natural images are also effective on ultrasound images, even more so than augmentations developed specifically for ultrasound images in some cases.

These wounds can take up to nine months to heal, making regular care essential to ensure healing and prevent severe outcomes like limb amputations. Many patients receive care at home from visiting nurses with varying levels of wound expertise, leading to inconsistent care. Problematic, non-healing wounds should be referred to wound specialists, but referral decisions in non-clinical settings are often erroneous, delayed, or unnecessary.\n  This paper introduces the Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT), a machine learning framework designed to assist visiting nurses in deciding whether to refer chronic wound patients.

DM-WAT combines visual and text features using an intermediate fusion approach. To address challenges posed by a small and imbalanced dataset, it integrates image and text augmentation with transfer learning to achieve high performance. In evaluations, DM-WAT achieved 77% with std 3% accuracy and a 70% with std 2% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches.

In this paper, we propose a novel method called Polyhedra Encoding Transformer (PE-Transformer) for dMRI, designed specifically to handle spherical signals. Our approach involves projecting an icosahedral polygon onto a unit sphere to resample signals from predetermined directions. These resampled signals are then transformed into embeddings, which are processed by a transformer encoder that incorporates orientational information reflective of the icosahedral structure. Through experimental validation with various gradient encoding protocols, our method demonstrates superior accuracy in estimating multi-compartment models and Fiber Orientation Distributions (FOD), outperforming both conventional CNN architectures and standard transformers.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.13370v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Data-driven machine learning has made significant strides in medical image analysis. However, most existing methods are tailored to specific modalities and assume a particular resolution (often isotropic). This limits their generalizability in clinical settings, where variations in scan appearance arise from differences in sequence parameters, resolution, and orientation. Furthermore, most general-purpose models are designed for healthy subjects and suffer from performance degradation when pathology is present. We introduce UNA (Unraveling Normal Anatomy), the first modality-agnostic learning approach for normal brain anatomy reconstruction that can handle both healthy scans and cases with pathology. We propose a fluid-driven anomaly randomization method that generates an unlimited number of realistic pathology profiles on-the-fly. UNA is trained on a combination of synthetic and real data, and can be applied directly to real images with potential pathology without the need for fine-tuning. We demonstrate UNA's effectiveness in reconstructing healthy brain anatomy and showcase its direct application to anomaly detection, using both simulated and real images from 3D healthy and stroke datasets, including CT and MRI scans. By bridging the gap between healthy and diseased images, UNA enables the use of general-purpose models on diseased images, opening up new opportunities for large-scale analysis of uncurated clinical images in the presence of pathology.

While these approaches can build highly realistic maps, large-scale SLAM still remains a challenge because they require a large number of Gaussian images for mapping and adjacent images as keyframes for tracking. We propose a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM method, VIGS SLAM, that utilizes sensor fusion of RGB-D and IMU sensors for large-scale indoor environments. To reduce the computational load of 3DGS-based tracking, we adopt an ICP-based tracking framework that combines IMU preintegration to provide a good initial guess for accurate pose estimation. Our proposed method is the first to propose that Gaussian Splatting-based SLAM can be effectively performed in large-scale environments by integrating IMU sensor measurements.

Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled precise 3D mapping and scene understanding by rendering photo-realistic images. However, existing 3DGS methods often struggle to accurately reconstruct a 3D map that reflects the actual scale and geometry of the real world, which degrades localization performance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS method called Geometry-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GeomGS). This method fully integrates LiDAR data into 3D Gaussian primitives via a probabilistic approach, as opposed to approaches that only use LiDAR as initial points or introduce simple constraints for Gaussian points. To this end, we introduce a Geometric Confidence Score (GCS), which identifies the structural reliability of each Gaussian point. The GCS is optimized simultaneously with Gaussians under probabilistic distance constraints to construct a precise structure. Furthermore, we propose a novel localization method that fully utilizes both the geometric and photometric properties of GeomGS.

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections.

Accurate alignment and delineation of images acquired at different field strengths such as 3T and 7T, remain challenging research tasks. Purpose: To address alignment challenges and enable consistent tumor segmentation across different MRI field strengths. Study type: Retrospective. Subjects: Nine female subjects with breast tumors were involved: six histologically proven invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC) and three fibroadenomas. Field strength/sequence: Imaging was performed at 3T and 7T scanners using post-contrast T1-weighted three-dimensional time-resolved angiography with stochastic trajectories (TWIST) sequence. Assessments: The method's performance for joint image registration and tumor segmentation was evaluated using several quantitative metrics, including signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), normalized cross-correlation (NCC), Dice coefficient, F1 score, and relative sum of squared differences (rel SSD). Statistical tests: The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between the registration and segmentation metrics. Results: When calculated for each subject individually, the PSNR was in a range from 27.5 to 34.5 dB, and the SSIM was from 82.6 to 92.8%. The model achieved an NCC from 96.4 to 99.3% and a Dice coefficient of 62.9 to 95.3%. The F1 score was between 55.4 and 93.2% and the rel SSD was in the range of 2.0 and 7.5%. The segmentation metrics Dice and F1 Score are highly correlated (0.995), while a moderate correlation between NCC and SSIM (0.681) was found for registration.

Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for uneven energy modulation. AuxT is lightweight and plug-and-play to be integrated into diverse LIC models to address the slow convergence issue. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accelerate training of LIC models by 2 times and simultaneously achieves an average 1\\% BD-rate reduction. To our best knowledge, this is one of the first successful attempt that can significantly improve the convergence of LIC with comparable or superior rate-distortion performance.

To alleviate this problem, we introduce a semi-automated framework for the identification of spurious behavior from both data and model perspective by leveraging insights from eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). This allows the retrieval of spurious data points and the detection of model circuits that encode the associated prediction rules. Moreover, we demonstrate how these shortcut encodings can be used for XAI-based sample- and pixel-level data annotation, providing valuable information for bias mitigation methods to unlearn the undesired shortcut behavior. We show the applicability of our framework using four medical datasets across two modalities, featuring controlled and real-world spurious correlations caused by data artifacts.

Most recent works of GUI action grounding leverage large GUI datasets to fine-tune MLLMs. However, the fine-tuning data always covers limited GUI environments, and we find the performance of the resulting model deteriorates in novel environments. We argue that the GUI grounding models should be further aligned to the novel environments to reveal their full potential, when the inference is known to involve novel environments, i.e., environments not used during the previous fine-tuning. To realize this, we first propose GUI-Bee, an MLLM-based autonomous agent, to collect high-quality, environment-specific data through exploration and then continuously fine-tune GUI grounding models with the collected data.

We then show that our model generates plausible images even after extreme palette transfers, respecting user query. Our method can optionally condition on the source texture in part or all of the image. In doing so, we overcome a common problem in existing image colorization methods that are unable to produce colors with a different luminance than the input. We evaluate several possibilities for texture conditioning and their trade-offs, including luminance, image gradients, and thresholded gradients, the latter of which performed best in maintaining texture and color control simultaneously.

However, the process of preparing datasets for training segmentation DNNs is both labor-intensive and costly, as it typically requires pixel-level annotations for each object of interest. To mitigate this challenge, alternative approaches such as using weak labels (e.g., bounding boxes or scribbles) or less precise (noisy) annotations can be employed. Noisy and weak labels are significantly quicker to generate, allowing for more annotated images within the same time frame. However, the potential decrease in annotation quality may adversely impact the segmentation performance of the resulting model. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive cost-effectiveness evaluation on six variants of annotation strategies (9~10 sub-variants in total) across 4 datasets and conclude that the common practice of precisely outlining objects of interest is virtually never the optimal approach when annotation budget is limited. Both noisy and weak annotations showed usage cases that yield similar performance to the perfectly annotated counterpart, yet had significantly better cost-effectiveness.

In particular, we propose a novel architecture that biases object-centric models toward disentangling shape and texture components into two non-overlapping subsets of the latent space dimensions. These subsets are known a priori, hence before the training process. Experiments on a range of object-centric benchmarks reveal that our approach achieves the desired disentanglement while also numerically improving baseline performance in most cases. In addition, we show that our method can generate novel textures for a specific object or transfer textures between objects with distinct shapes.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2402.16291v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Detecting objects across varying scales is still a challenge in computer vision, particularly in agricultural applications like Rice Leaf Disease (RLD) detection, where objects exhibit significant scale variations (SV). Conventional object detection (OD) like Faster R-CNN, SSD, and YOLO methods often fail to effectively address SV, leading to reduced accuracy and missed detections. To tackle this, we propose SaRPFF (Self-Attention with Register-based Pyramid Feature Fusion), a novel module designed to enhance multi-scale object detection. SaRPFF integrates 2D-Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) with Register tokens, improving feature interpretability by mitigating artifacts within MHSA. Additionally, it integrates efficient attention atrous convolutions into the pyramid feature fusion and introduce a deconvolutional layer for refined up-sampling. We evaluate SaRPFF on YOLOv7 using the MRLD and COCO datasets. Our approach demonstrates a +2.61% improvement in Average Precision (AP) on the MRLD dataset compared to the baseline FPN method in YOLOv7. Furthermore, SaRPFF outperforms other FPN variants, including BiFPN, NAS-FPN, and PANET, showcasing its versatility and potential to advance OD techniques. This study highlights SaRPFF effectiveness in addressing SV challenges and its adaptability across FPN-based OD models.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2404.00409v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In this paper, we present an implicit surface reconstruction method with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), namely 3DGSR, that allows for accurate 3D reconstruction with intricate details while inheriting the high efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. The key insight is incorporating an implicit signed distance field (SDF) within 3D Gaussians to enable them to be aligned and jointly optimized. First, we introduce a differentiable SDF-to-opacity transformation function that converts SDF values into corresponding Gaussians' opacities. This function connects the SDF and 3D Gaussians, allowing for unified optimization and enforcing surface constraints on the 3D Gaussians. During learning, optimizing the 3D Gaussians provides supervisory signals for SDF learning, enabling the reconstruction of intricate details. However, this only provides sparse supervisory signals to the SDF at locations occupied by Gaussians, which is insufficient for learning a continuous SDF. Then, to address this limitation, we incorporate volumetric rendering and align the rendered geometric attributes (depth, normal) with those derived from 3D Gaussians. This consistency regularization introduces supervisory signals to locations not covered by discrete 3D Gaussians, effectively eliminating redundant surfaces outside the Gaussian sampling range. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that our 3DGSR method enables high-quality 3D surface reconstruction while preserving the efficiency and rendering quality of 3DGS. Besides, our method competes favorably with leading surface reconstruction techniques while offering a more efficient learning process and much better rendering qualities.

This allows for end-to-end mesh reconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering. Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complex designs in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trained with low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enables significantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with less compute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction from sparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, including text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation.

With efficiency being a high priority for scaling such models, we observed that the state-of-the-art method Mask2Former uses 50% of its compute only on the transformer encoder. This is due to the retention of a full-length token-level representation of all backbone feature scales at each encoder layer. With this observation, we propose a strategy termed PROgressive Token Length SCALing for Efficient transformer encoders (PRO-SCALE) that can be plugged-in to the Mask2Former segmentation architecture to significantly reduce the computational cost. The underlying principle of PRO-SCALE is: progressively scale the length of the tokens with the layers of the encoder. This allows PRO-SCALE to reduce computations by a large margin with minimal sacrifice in performance (~52% encoder and ~27% overall GFLOPs reduction with no drop in performance on COCO dataset). Experiments conducted on public benchmarks demonstrates PRO-SCALE's flexibility in architectural configurations, and exhibits potential for extension beyond the settings of segmentation tasks to encompass object detection.

A common problem in continual learning is the classification layer's bias towards the most recent task. Traditionally, methods have relied on incorporating data from past tasks during training to mitigate this issue. However, the recent shift in continual learning to memory-free environments has rendered these approaches infeasible. In this study, we propose a solution focused on the testing phase. We first introduce a simple Out-of-Task Detection method, OTD, designed to accurately identify samples from past tasks during testing. Leveraging OTD, we then propose: (1) an Adaptive Retention mechanism for dynamically tuning the classifier layer on past task data; (2) an Adaptive Correction mechanism for revising predictions when the model classifies data from previous tasks into classes from the current task. We name our approach Adaptive Retention & Correction (ARC). While designed for memory-free environments, ARC also proves effective in memory-based settings. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method can be plugged in to virtually any existing continual learning approach without requiring any modifications to its training procedure. Specifically, when integrated with state-of-the-art approaches, ARC achieves an average performance increase of 2.7% and 2.6% on the CIFAR-100 and Imagenet-R datasets, respectively.",

Current MIL research primarily relies on embedding-based approaches, which extract patch features using a pre-trained feature extractor and aggregate them for slide-level prediction. Despite the critical role of feature extraction, there is limited guidance on selecting optimal feature extractors to maximize WSI performance. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating MIL feature extractors across three dimensions: pre-training dataset, backbone model, and pre-training method. Extensive experiments were conducted on two public WSI datasets (TCGA-NSCLC and Camelyon16) using four state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL models. Our findings reveal that: 1) selecting a robust self-supervised learning (SSL) method has a greater impact on performance than relying solely on an in-domain pre-training dataset; 2) prioritizing Transformer-based backbones with deeper architectures over CNN-based models; and 3) using larger, more diverse pre-training datasets significantly enhances classification outcomes. We hope that these insights can provide practical guidance for optimizing WSI classification and explain the reasons behind the performance advantages of the current SOTA pathology foundation models.

However, for Vision-LLMs (VLLMs), how visual representations impact the predictions from a decoder-only language model remains largely unexplored.

In this work, we employ the contribution allocation and noise perturbation methods to measure the contributions of visual representations for token predictions. Our attribution analysis shows that visual representations in mid-to-later layers that are highly relevant to the prompt contribute significantly to predictions. Based on these insights, we propose VisEdit, a novel model editor for VLLMs that effectively corrects knowledge by editing intermediate visual representations in regions important to the edit prompt.

The transferability of adversarial skeletal sequences enables attacks in real-world HAR scenarios, such as autonomous driving, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interactions. However, most existing skeleton-based HAR (S-HAR) attacks are primarily designed for white-box scenarios and exhibit weak adversarial transferability. Therefore, they cannot be considered true transfer-based S-HAR attacks. More importantly, the reason for this failure remains unclear. In this paper, we study this phenomenon through the lens of loss surface, and find that its sharpness contributes to the weak transferability in S-HAR. Inspired by this observation, we assume and empirically validate that smoothening the rugged loss landscape could potentially improve adversarial transferability in S-HAR.

To address the problem of ``cross-dataset gaze estimation'', we propose a novel Evidential Inter-intra Fusion EIF framework, for training a cross-dataset model that performs well across all source and unseen domains. Specifically, we build independent single-dataset branches for various datasets where the data space is partitioned into overlapping subspaces within each dataset for local regression, and further create a cross-dataset branch to integrate the generalizable features from single-dataset branches. Furthermore, evidential regressors based on the Normal and Inverse-Gamma (NIG) distribution are designed to additionally provide uncertainty estimation apart from predicting gaze.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.02441v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: In biomedical imaging analysis, the dichotomy between 2D and 3D data presents a significant challenge. While 3D volumes offer superior real-world applicability, they are less available for each modality and not easy to train in large scale, whereas 2D samples are abundant but less comprehensive. This paper introduces Cross-D Conv operation, a novel approach that bridges the dimensional gap by learning the phase shifting in the Fourier domain. Our method enables seamless weight transfer between 2D and 3D convolution operations, effectively facilitating cross-dimensional learning. The proposed architecture leverages the abundance of 2D training data to enhance 3D model performance, offering a practical solution to the multimodal data scarcity challenge in 3D medical model pretraining. Experimental validation on the RadImagenet (2D) and multimodal volumetric sets demonstrates that our approach achieves comparable or superior performance in feature quality assessment. The enhanced convolution operation presents new opportunities for developing efficient classification and segmentation models in medical imaging. This work represents an advancement in cross-dimensional and multimodal medical image analysis, offering a robust framework for utilizing 2D priors in 3D model pretraining while maintaining computational efficiency of 2D training.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.08923v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Contrastive learning models have demonstrated impressive abilities to capture semantic similarities by aligning representations in the embedding space. However, their performance can be limited by the quality of the training data and its inherent biases. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have been applied to generative models to align them with human preferences, their use in contrastive learning has yet to be explored. This paper introduces a novel method for training contrastive learning models using Preference Optimization (PO) to break down complex concepts. Our method systematically aligns model behavior with desired preferences, enhancing performance on the targeted task. In particular, we focus on enhancing model robustness against typographic attacks, commonly seen in contrastive models like CLIP. We further apply our method to disentangle gender understanding and mitigate gender biases, offering a more nuanced control over these sensitive attributes. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained using PO outperform standard contrastive learning techniques while retaining their ability to handle adversarial challenges and maintain accuracy on other downstream tasks. This makes our method well-suited for tasks requiring fairness, robustness, and alignment with specific preferences. We evaluate our method on several vision-language tasks, tackling challenges such as typographic attacks. Additionally, we explore the model's ability to disentangle gender concepts and mitigate gender bias, showcasing the versatility of our approach.",

However, most existing MVCC methods create cross-views by combining any two views, leading to a high volume of unreliable pairs. Furthermore, these approaches often overlook discrepancies in multi-view representations, resulting in representation degeneration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel model called Dual-Weighted Contrastive Learning (DWCL) for Multi-View Clustering. Specifically, to reduce the impact of unreliable cross-views, we introduce an innovative Best-Other (B-O) contrastive mechanism that enhances the representation of individual views at a low computational cost. Furthermore, we develop a dual weighting strategy that combines a view quality weight, reflecting the quality of each view, with a view discrepancy weight. This approach effectively mitigates representation degeneration by downplaying cross-views that are both low in quality and high in discrepancy. We theoretically validate the efficiency of the B-O contrastive mechanism and the effectiveness of the dual weighting strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWCL outperforms previous methods across eight multi-view datasets, showcasing superior performance and robustness in MVCC. Specifically, our method achieves absolute accuracy improvements of 5.4\\% and 5.6\\% compared to state-of-the-art methods on the Caltech6V7 and MSRCv1 datasets, respectively.",

To address this problem, we introduce MultiFoley, a model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports multimodal conditioning through text, audio, and video. Given a silent video and a text prompt, MultiFoley allows users to create clean sounds (e.g., skateboard wheels spinning without wind noise) or more whimsical sounds (e.g., making a lion's roar sound like a cat's meow). MultiFoley also allows users to choose reference audio from sound effects (SFX) libraries or partial videos for conditioning. A key novelty of our model lies in its joint training on both internet video datasets with low-quality audio and professional SFX recordings, enabling high-quality, full-bandwidth (48kHz) audio generation. Through automated evaluations and human studies, we demonstrate that MultiFoley successfully generates synchronized high-quality sounds across varied conditional inputs and outperforms existing methods.

Recent methods combine robust features from web-scale pretrained backbones with new features learned from source data, and this has dramatically improved benchmark results. However, it remains unclear if DG finetuning methods are becoming better over time, or if improved benchmark performance is simply an artifact of stronger pre-training. Prior studies have shown that perceptual similarity to pre-training data correlates with zero-shot performance, but we find the effect limited in the DG setting. Instead, we posit that having perceptually similar data in pretraining is not enough; and that it is how well these data were learned that determines performance. This leads us to introduce the Alignment Hypothesis, which states that the final DG performance will be high if and only if alignment of image and class label text embeddings is high. Our experiments confirm the Alignment Hypothesis is true, and we use it as an analysis tool of existing DG methods evaluated on DomainBed datasets by splitting evaluation data into In-pretraining (IP) and Out-of-pretraining (OOP). We show that all evaluated DG methods struggle on DomainBed-OOP, while recent methods excel on DomainBed-IP.

To address this need, we present OmniHD-Scenes, a large-scale multimodal dataset that provides comprehensive omnidirectional high-definition data. The OmniHD-Scenes dataset combines data from 128-beam LiDAR, six cameras, and six 4D imaging radar systems to achieve full environmental perception.

We also propose a novel 4D annotation pipeline. To date, we have annotated 200 clips with more than 514K precise 3D bounding boxes. These clips also include semantic segmentation annotations for static scene elements. Additionally, we introduce a novel automated pipeline for generation of the dense occupancy ground truth, which effectively leverages information from non-key frames. Alongside the proposed dataset, we establish comprehensive evaluation metrics, baseline models, and benchmarks for 3D detection and semantic occupancy prediction. These benchmarks utilize surround-view cameras and 4D imaging radar to explore cost-effective sensor solutions for autonomous driving applications.

Such issues are mainly caused by the lack of high-quality paired training data, as well as the self-supervised training paradigm adopted in these methods, which forces the model to in-paint the masked regions, leading to ambiguity between synthesizing the masked objects and restoring the background. To address these issues, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy with human-in-the-loop to create high-quality paired training data, aiming to train a Robust Object Remover (RORem). We first collect 60K training pairs from open-source datasets to train an initial object removal model for generating removal samples, and then utilize human feedback to select a set of high-quality object removal pairs, with which we train a discriminator to automate the following training data generation process. By iterating this process for several rounds, we finally obtain a substantial object removal dataset with over 200K pairs. Fine-tuning the pre-trained stable diffusion model with this dataset, we obtain our RORem, which demonstrates state-of-the-art object removal performance in terms of both reliability and image quality.

Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

In addition to visual grounding that detects specific objects corresponded to given instruction, aerial detection, which detects all objects of multiple categories, is also a valuable and challenging task for RS foundation models.

Most of the researches on action recognition methods focused on improving the performance via various deep learning methods rather than the classification of skeleton points. The topological modeling between skeleton points and body parts was seldom considered. Although some studies have used a data-driven approach to classify the topology of the skeleton point, the nature of the skeleton point in terms of kinematics has not been taken into consideration. Therefore, in this paper, we draw on the theory of kinematics to adapt the topological relations of the skeleton point and propose a topological relation classification based on body parts and distance from core of body. To synthesize these topological relations for action recognition, we propose a novel Hypergraph Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (HFGCN). In particular, the proposed model is able to focus on the human skeleton points and the different body parts simultaneously, and thus construct the topology, which improves the recognition accuracy obviously. We use a hypergraph to represent the categorical relationships of these skeleton points and incorporate the hypergraph into a graph convolution network to model the higher-order relationships among the skeleton points and enhance the feature representation of the network. In addition, our proposed hypergraph attention module and hypergraph graph convolution module optimize topology modeling in temporal and channel dimensions, respectively, to further enhance the feature representation of the network. We conducted extensive experiments on three widely used datasets.The results validate that our proposed method can achieve the best performance when compared with the state-of-the-art skeleton-based methods.",

Manually placing these key points is complex, time-consuming, and requires expert knowledge. While some machine learning methods have been proposed for automatic tooth landmark detection in 3D Intraoral Scans (IOS), research remains limited, with no fully end-to-end approaches that avoid teeth segmentation. We propose CHaRNet (Conditioned Heatmap Regression Network), the first end-to-end deep learning method for tooth landmark detection in 3D IOS. Unlike traditional two-stage methods that segment teeth before detecting landmarks, CHaRNet directly detects landmarks on the input point cloud. It consists of four key modules: (1) a point cloud encoder, (2) a point cloud decoder with a heatmap regression head, (3) a teeth presence classification head, and (4) the innovative Conditioned Heatmap Regression (CHaR) module. The CHaR module refines landmark regression by leveraging teeth presence classification, enabling dynamic adaptation to cases with missing teeth and improving accuracy in complex dental models. We evaluate CHaRNet using five point cloud learning algorithms to validate the effectiveness of the CHaR module and test it on a clinical dataset of 1,214 annotated 3D dental models. Both the dataset and code will be publicly released to address the lack of open datasets in orthodontics, promote benchmarking, and inspire new research. CHaRNet achieves a Mean Euclidean Distance Error (MEDE) of 1.28 mm and a Mean Success Ratio (MSR) of 82.40%, demonstrating robust performance.

The core design philosophy of VideoLLaMA3 is vision-centric. The meaning of \"vision-centric\" is two-fold: the vision-centric training paradigm and vision-centric framework design. The key insight of our vision-centric training paradigm is that high-quality image-text data is crucial for both image and video understanding. Instead of preparing massive video-text datasets, we focus on constructing large-scale and high-quality image-text datasets. VideoLLaMA3 has four training stages: 1) Vision Encoder Adaptation, which enables vision encoder to accept images of variable resolutions as input; 2) Vision-Language Alignment, which jointly tunes the vision encoder, projector, and LLM with large-scale image-text data covering multiple types (including scene images, documents, charts) as well as text-only data. 3) Multi-task Fine-tuning, which incorporates image-text SFT data for downstream tasks and video-text data to establish a foundation for video understanding. 4) Video-centric Fine-tuning, which further improves the model's capability in video understanding. As for the framework design, to better capture fine-grained details in images, the pretrained vision encoder is adapted to encode images of varying sizes into vision tokens with corresponding numbers, rather than a fixed number of tokens.

ILF trains a lightweight module to predict future features in the denoising process by leveraging the outputs from a chosen diffusion backbone block at a given time step. This approach exploits two key intuitions; (1) the outputs of a given block at adjacent time steps are similar, and (2) performing partial computations for a step imposes a lower burden on the model than skipping the step entirely. Our method is highly flexible, since we find that the feedback module itself can simply be a block from the diffusion backbone, with all settings copied. Its influence on the diffusion forward can be tempered with a learnable scaling factor from zero initialization. We train this module using distillation losses; however, unlike some prior work where a full diffusion backbone serves as the student, our model freezes the backbone, training only the feedback module. While many efforts to optimize diffusion models focus on achieving acceptable image quality in extremely few steps (1-4 steps), our emphasis is on matching best case results (typically achieved in 20 steps) while significantly reducing runtime. ILF achieves this balance effectively, demonstrating strong performance for both class-to-image generation with diffusion transformer (DiT) and text-to-image generation with DiT-based PixArt-alpha and PixArt-sigma.

Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) is an alternative approach that aims to identify any anomaly as an outlier from a healthy training distribution. A prevalent strategy for UAD in brain MRI involves using generative models to learn the reconstruction of healthy brain anatomy for a given input image. As these models should fail to reconstruct unhealthy structures, the reconstruction errors indicate anomalies. However, a significant challenge is to balance the accurate reconstruction of healthy anatomy and the undesired replication of abnormal structures. While diffusion models have shown promising results with detailed and accurate reconstructions, they face challenges in preserving intensity characteristics, resulting in false positives. We propose conditioning the denoising process of diffusion models with additional information derived from a latent representation of the input image. We demonstrate that this conditioning allows for accurate and local adaptation to the general input intensity distribution while avoiding the replication of unhealthy structures. We compare the novel approach to different state-of-the-art methods and for different data sets. Our results show substantial improvements in the segmentation performance, with the Dice score improved by 11.9%, 20.0%, and 44.6%, for the BraTS, ATLAS and MSLUB data sets, respectively, while maintaining competitive performance on the WMH data set.

In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity to $O(T)$, where $T$ is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call ``attention locality''. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-$k$ key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only $O(\\log T)$ tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible.",

This paper introduces \\textit{LatentExplainer}, a framework for automatically generating semantically meaningful explanations of latent variables in deep generative models. \\textit{LatentExplainer} tackles three main challenges: inferring the meaning of latent variables, aligning explanations with inductive biases, and handling varying degrees of explainability. Our approach perturbs latent variables, interpreting changes in generated data, and uses multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to produce human-understandable explanations. We evaluate our proposed method on several real-world and synthetic datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance in generating high-quality explanations for latent variables.

However, SMS reconstruction remains challenging due to complex signal interactions between and within the excited slices. In this study, we introduce ROGER, a robust SMS MRI reconstruction method based on deep generative priors. Utilizing denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM), ROGER begins with Gaussian noise and gradually recovers individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while enforcing data consistency from measured k-space data within the readout concatenation framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM training can be performed on single-slice images without requiring modifications for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method incorporates a low-frequency enhancement (LFE) module to address the practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo (FSE) and echo planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed fully-sampled autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments on both retrospectively and prospectively accelerated datasets demonstrate that ROGER consistently outperforms existing methods, enhancing both anatomical and functional imaging with strong out-of-distribution generalization.

To truly understand how and why people interact with one another, we must infer the underlying mental states that give rise to the social interactions, i.e., Theory of Mind reasoning in multi-agent interactions. Additionally, social interactions are often multi-modal -- we can watch people's actions, hear their conversations, and/or read about their past behaviors. For AI systems to successfully and safely interact with people in real-world environments, they also need to understand people's mental states as well as their inferences about each other's mental states based on multi-modal information about their interactions. For this, we introduce MuMA-ToM, a Multi-modal Multi-Agent Theory of Mind benchmark. MuMA-ToM is the first multi-modal Theory of Mind benchmark that evaluates mental reasoning in embodied multi-agent interactions. In MuMA-ToM, we provide video and text descriptions of people's multi-modal behavior in realistic household environments. Based on the context, we then ask questions about people's goals, beliefs, and beliefs about others' goals. We validated MuMA-ToM in a human experiment and provided a human baseline. We also proposed a novel multi-modal, multi-agent ToM model, LIMP (Language model-based Inverse Multi-agent Planning).

FHE enables computation directly on encrypted data, safeguarding the entire machine learning pipeline, including data and model confidentiality. However, existing FHE-based implementations for deep neural networks face significant challenges in computational cost, latency, and scalability, limiting their practical deployment. This paper introduces DCT-CryptoNets, a novel approach that operates directly in the frequency-domain to reduce the burden of computationally expensive non-linear activations and homomorphic bootstrap operations during private inference. It does so by utilizing the discrete cosine transform (DCT), commonly employed in JPEG encoding, which has inherent compatibility with remote computing services where images are generally stored and transmitted in this encoded format. DCT-CryptoNets demonstrates a substantial latency reductions of up to 5.3$\\times$ compared to prior work on benchmark image classification tasks. Notably, it demonstrates inference on the ImageNet dataset within 2.5 hours (down from 12.5 hours on equivalent 96-thread compute resources). Furthermore, by learning perceptually salient low-frequency information DCT-CryptoNets improves the reliability of encrypted predictions compared to RGB-based networks by reducing error accumulating homomorphic bootstrap operations. DCT-CryptoNets also demonstrates superior scalability to RGB-based networks by further reducing computational cost as image size increases. This study demonstrates a promising avenue for achieving efficient and practical private inference of deep learning models on high resolution images seen in real-world applications.",

    "title": "Truncated Consistency Models",
    "summary": "arXiv:2410.14895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Consistency models have recently been introduced to accelerate sampling from diffusion models by directly predicting the solution (i.e., data) of the probability flow ODE (PF ODE) from initial noise. However, the training of consistency models requires learning to map all intermediate points along PF ODE trajectories to their corresponding endpoints. This task is much more challenging than the ultimate objective of one-step generation, which only concerns the PF ODE's noise-to-data mapping. We empirically find that this training paradigm limits the one-step generation performance of consistency models. To address this issue, we generalize consistency training to the truncated time range, which allows the model to ignore denoising tasks at earlier time steps and focus its capacity on generation. We propose a new parameterization of the consistency function and a two-stage training procedure that prevents the truncated-time training from collapsing to a trivial solution. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet $64\\times64$ datasets show that our method achieves better one-step and two-step FIDs than the state-of-the-art consistency models such as iCT-deep, using more than 2$\\times$ smaller networks.

Our study further reveals that the monotonic fall phase of Kullback-Leibler divergence begins when the training dataset size reaches the dimension of the data points. Along the way, we provide a mathematically precise definition of memorization to non-memorization transition when only finite number of data points are available. It is shown that the simplified model also features this transition during the monotonic fall phase of the aforementioned Kullback-Leibler divergence. For large-scale practical diffusion models, we explain why higher number of diffusion steps enhance production quality based on the theoretical arguments presented before. In addition, we show that higher diffusion steps does not necessarily help in reducing memorization.

Geometric deep learning algorithms have shown promise for learning features on meshes, including cardiovascular research applications. This study empirically analyzes various backends for predicting vFFR fields in coronary arteries as CFD surrogates, comparing six backends for learning hemodynamics on meshes using CFD solutions as ground truth.\n  The study has two parts: i) Using 1,500 synthetic left coronary artery bifurcations, models were trained to predict pressure-related fields for vFFR reconstruction, comparing different learning variables. ii) Using 427 patient-specific CFD simulations, experiments were repeated focusing on the best-performing learning variable from the synthetic dataset.\n  Most backends performed well on the synthetic dataset, especially when predicting pressure drop over the manifold. Transformer-based backends outperformed others when predicting pressure and vFFR fields and were the only models achieving strong performance on patient-specific data, excelling in both average per-point error and vFFR accuracy in stenotic lesions.\n  These results suggest geometric deep learning backends can effectively replace CFD for simple geometries, while transformer-based networks are superior for complex, heterogeneous datasets.

However, existing methods struggle with \"copy-paste\" artifacts and low similarity issues, primarily due to their reliance on low-level facial image information. This dependence can result in rigid facial appearances and artifacts reflecting irrelevant details. To address these challenges, we propose EchoVideo, which employs two key strategies: (1) an Identity Image-Text Fusion Module (IITF) that integrates high-level semantic features from text, capturing clean facial identity representations while discarding occlusions, poses, and lighting variations to avoid the introduction of artifacts; (2) a two-stage training strategy, incorporating a stochastic method in the second phase to randomly utilize shallow facial information. The objective is to balance the enhancements in fidelity provided by shallow features while mitigating excessive reliance on them. This strategy encourages the model to utilize high-level features during training, ultimately fostering a more robust representation of facial identities. EchoVideo effectively preserves facial identities and maintains full-body integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves excellent results in generating high-quality, controllability and fidelity videos.",

    "title": "SRMT: Shared Memory for Multi-agent Lifelong Pathfinding",
    "summary": "Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) demonstrates significant progress in solving cooperative and competitive multi-agent problems in various environments. One of the principal challenges in MARL is the need for explicit prediction of the agents' behavior to achieve cooperation. To resolve this issue, we propose the Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer (SRMT) which extends memory transformers to multi-agent settings by pooling and globally broadcasting individual working memories, enabling agents to exchange information implicitly and coordinate their actions. We evaluate SRMT on the Partially Observable Multi-Agent Pathfinding problem in a toy Bottleneck navigation task that requires agents to pass through a narrow corridor and on a POGEMA benchmark set of tasks. In the Bottleneck task, SRMT consistently outperforms a variety of reinforcement learning baselines, especially under sparse rewards, and generalizes effectively to longer corridors than those seen during training. On POGEMA maps, including Mazes, Random, and MovingAI, SRMT is competitive with recent MARL, hybrid, and planning-based algorithms. These results suggest that incorporating shared recurrent memory into the transformer-based architectures can enhance coordination in decentralized multi-agent systems.

    "title": "Evolution and The Knightian Blindspot of Machine Learning",
    "summary": "This paper claims that machine learning (ML) largely overlooks an important facet of general intelligence: robustness to a qualitatively unknown future in an open world. Such robustness relates to Knightian uncertainty (KU) in economics, i.e. uncertainty that cannot be quantified, which is excluded from consideration in ML's key formalisms. This paper aims to identify this blind spot, argue its importance, and catalyze research into addressing it, which we believe is necessary to create truly robust open-world AI. To help illuminate the blind spot, we contrast one area of ML, reinforcement learning (RL), with the process of biological evolution. Despite staggering ongoing progress, RL still struggles in open-world situations, often failing under unforeseen situations. For example, the idea of zero-shot transferring a self-driving car policy trained only in the US to the UK currently seems exceedingly ambitious. In dramatic contrast, biological evolution routinely produces agents that thrive within an open world, sometimes even to situations that are remarkably out-of-distribution (e.g. invasive species; or humans, who do undertake such zero-shot international driving). Interestingly, evolution achieves such robustness without explicit theory, formalisms, or mathematical gradients. We explore the assumptions underlying RL's typical formalisms, showing how they limit RL's engagement with the unknown unknowns characteristic of an ever-changing complex world. Further, we identify mechanisms through which evolutionary processes foster robustness to novel and unpredictable challenges, and discuss potential pathways to algorithmically embody them. The conclusion is that the intriguing remaining fragility of ML may result from blind spots in its formalisms, and that significant gains may result from direct confrontation with the challenge of KU.",

    "title": "Debate Helps Weak-to-Strong Generalization",
    "summary": "Common methods for aligning already-capable models with desired behavior rely on the ability of humans to provide supervision. However, future superhuman models will surpass the capability of humans. Therefore, humans will only be able to weakly supervise superhuman models. This expected deficiency of human evaluation would weaken the safety of future AI systems. Scalable oversight and weak-to-strong generalization are two complementary approaches to tackle this issue. In this paper, we attempt to combine the strengths of these two approaches to further improve alignment. Specifically, we investigate ways of improving human supervision with a strong pretrained model and then supervise the strong model with enhanced weak human supervision. To make iterative empirical progress, we consider an analogy: can we use a strong model to improve weak model supervision and then use it to supervise the strong model? We empirically test it by finetuning a small weak model on ground truth labels with the additional help from a large strong model, and then finetuning the strong model on labels generated by the weak model. We find that debate can assist a weak model in extracting trustworthy information from an untrustworthy strong model, which provides leverage as context on samples when training a weak model. We also show that an ensemble of weak models helps exploit long arguments generated by strong model debaters and obtain a more robust supervision estimate. Extensive experiments on the OpenAI weak-to-strong NLP benchmarks show that the combination approach leads to better alignment, which indicates that debate has the potential to help weak-to-strong generalization.",

    "title": "Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding",
    "summary": "Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

    "summary": "With the rapid development of diffusion models, text-to-image(T2I) models have made significant progress, showcasing impressive abilities in prompt following and image generation. Recently launched models such as FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0, along with others like Dall-E3 and Stable Diffusion 3, have demonstrated exceptional performance across various complex tasks, raising questions about whether T2I models are moving towards general-purpose applicability. Beyond traditional image generation, these models exhibit capabilities across a range of fields, including controllable generation, image editing, video, audio, 3D, and motion generation, as well as computer vision tasks like semantic segmentation and depth estimation. However, current evaluation frameworks are insufficient to comprehensively assess these models' performance across expanding domains. To thoroughly evaluate these models, we developed the IMAGINE-E and tested six prominent models: FLUX.1, Ideogram2.0, Midjourney, Dall-E3, Stable Diffusion 3, and Jimeng. Our evaluation is divided into five key domains: structured output generation, realism, and physical consistency, specific domain generation, challenging scenario generation, and multi-style creation tasks. This comprehensive assessment highlights each model's strengths and limitations, particularly the outstanding performance of FLUX.1 and Ideogram2.0 in structured and specific domain tasks, underscoring the expanding applications and potential of T2I models as foundational AI tools. This study provides valuable insights into the current state and future trajectory of T2I models as they evolve towards general-purpose usability.

    "summary": "We introduce Sigma, an efficient large language model specialized for the system domain, empowered by a novel architecture including DiffQKV attention, and pre-trained on our meticulously collected system domain data. DiffQKV attention significantly enhances the inference efficiency of Sigma by optimizing the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) components in the attention mechanism differentially, based on their varying impacts on the model performance and efficiency indicators. Specifically, we (1) conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the model's varying sensitivity to the compression of K and V components, leading to the development of differentially compressed KV, and (2) propose augmented Q to expand the Q head dimension, which enhances the model's representation capacity with minimal impacts on the inference speed. Rigorous theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that DiffQKV attention significantly enhances efficiency, achieving up to a 33.36% improvement in inference speed over the conventional grouped-query attention (GQA) in long-context scenarios. We pre-train Sigma on 6T tokens from various sources, including 19.5B system domain data that we carefully collect and 1T tokens of synthesized and rewritten data. In general domains, Sigma achieves comparable performance to other state-of-arts models. In the system domain, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark AIMicius, where Sigma demonstrates remarkable performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming GPT-4 with an absolute improvement up to 52.5%.",

    "title": "Step-KTO: Optimizing Mathematical Reasoning through Stepwise Binary Feedback",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable success in mathematical reasoning. Despite progress in methods like chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency sampling, these advances often focus on final correctness without ensuring that the underlying reasoning process is coherent and reliable. This paper introduces Step-KTO, a training framework that combines process-level and outcome-level binary feedback to guide LLMs toward more trustworthy reasoning trajectories. By providing binary evaluations for both the intermediate reasoning steps and the final answer, Step-KTO encourages the model to adhere to logical progressions rather than relying on superficial shortcuts. Our experiments on challenging mathematical benchmarks show that Step-KTO significantly improves both final answer accuracy and the quality of intermediate reasoning steps. For example, on the MATH-500 dataset, Step-KTO achieves a notable improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over strong baselines. These results highlight the promise of integrating stepwise process feedback into LLM training, paving the way toward more interpretable and dependable reasoning capabilities.",

    "title": "Can We Generate Images with CoT? Let's Verify and Reinforce Image Generation Step by Step",
    "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been extensively explored in large models to tackle complex understanding tasks. However, it still remains an open question whether such strategies can be applied to verifying and reinforcing image generation scenarios. In this paper, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the potential of CoT reasoning to enhance autoregressive image generation. We focus on three techniques: scaling test-time computation for verification, aligning model preferences with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and integrating these techniques for complementary effects. Our results demonstrate that these approaches can be effectively adapted and combined to significantly improve image generation performance. Furthermore, given the pivotal role of reward models in our findings, we propose the Potential Assessment Reward Model (PARM) and PARM++, specialized for autoregressive image generation. PARM adaptively assesses each generation step through a potential assessment approach, merging the strengths of existing reward models, and PARM++ further introduces a reflection mechanism to self-correct the generated unsatisfactory image. Using our investigated reasoning strategies, we enhance a baseline model, Show-o, to achieve superior results, with a significant +24% improvement on the GenEval benchmark, surpassing Stable Diffusion 3 by +15%. We hope our study provides unique insights and paves a new path for integrating CoT reasoning with autoregressive image generation.
