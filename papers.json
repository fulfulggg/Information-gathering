    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15320v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Model immunization is an emerging direction that aims to mitigate the potential risk of misuse associated with open-sourced models and advancing adaptation methods. The idea is to make the released models' weights difficult to fine-tune on certain harmful applications, hence the name ``immunized''. Recent work on model immunization focuses on the single-concept setting. However, models need to be immunized against multiple concepts in real-world situations. To address this gap, we propose an immunization algorithm that, simultaneously, learns a single ``difficult initialization'' for adaptation methods over a set of concepts. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable merging layer that combines a set of model weights adapted over multiple concepts. In our experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-concept immunization by generalizing prior work's experiment setup of re-learning and personalization adaptation to multiple concepts.",

In this work, we rethink the NTP for autoregressive image generation and propose a novel Next Patch Prediction (NPP) paradigm. Our key idea is to group and aggregate image tokens into patch tokens containing high information density. With patch tokens as a shorter input sequence, the autoregressive model is trained to predict the next patch, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost. We further propose a multi-scale coarse-to-fine patch grouping strategy that exploits the natural hierarchical property of image data. Experiments on a diverse range of models (100M-1.4B parameters) demonstrate that the next patch prediction paradigm could reduce the training cost to around 0.6 times while improving image generation quality by up to 1.0 FID score on the ImageNet benchmark. We highlight that our method retains the original autoregressive model architecture without introducing additional trainable parameters or specifically designing a custom image tokenizer, thus ensuring flexibility and seamless adaptation to various autoregressive models for visual generation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15322v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose to synthesize high-quality and synchronized audio, given video and optional text conditions, using a novel multimodal joint training framework MMAudio. In contrast to single-modality training conditioned on (limited) video data only, MMAudio is jointly trained with larger-scale, readily available text-audio data to learn to generate semantically aligned high-quality audio samples. Additionally, we improve audio-visual synchrony with a conditional synchronization module that aligns video conditions with audio latents at the frame level. Trained with a flow matching objective, MMAudio achieves new video-to-audio state-of-the-art among public models in terms of audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization, while having a low inference time (1.23s to generate an 8s clip) and just 157M parameters. MMAudio also achieves surprisingly competitive performance in text-to-audio generation, showing that joint training does not hinder single-modality performance.

One such task involves the design and evaluation for a subsystem of the perception system for object detection and tracking. The challenge in the creation of software to solve the task is in discovering the need for a dataset, annotation of the dataset, selection of features, integration and refinement of existing algorithms, while evaluating performance metrics through training and testing. This research effort focuses on the development of a machine learning pipeline emphasizing the inclusion of assurance methods with increasing automation. In the process, a new dataset was created by collecting videos of moving object such as Roomba vacuum cleaner, emulating search and rescue (SAR) for indoor environment. Individual frames were extracted from the videos and labeled using a combination of manual and automated techniques. This annotated dataset was refined for accuracy by initially training it on YOLOv4. After the refinement of the dataset it was trained on a second YOLOv4 and a Mask R-CNN model, which is deployed on a Parrot Mambo drone to perform real-time object detection and tracking. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in accurately detecting and tracking the Roomba across multiple trials, achieving an average loss of 0.1942 and 96% accuracy.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15389v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Histopathology, the microscopic examination of tissue samples, is essential for disease diagnosis and prognosis. Accurate segmentation and identification of key regions in histopathology images are crucial for developing automated solutions. However, state-of-art deep learning segmentation methods like UNet require extensive labels, which is both costly and time-consuming, particularly when dealing with multiple stainings. To mitigate this, multi-stain segmentation methods such as MDS1 and UDAGAN have been developed, which reduce the need for labels by requiring only one (source) stain to be labelled. Nonetheless, obtaining source stain labels can still be challenging, and segmentation models fail when they are unavailable. This article shows that through self-supervised pre-training, including SimCLR, BYOL, and a novel approach, HR-CS-CO, the performance of these segmentation methods (UNet, MDS1, and UDAGAN) can be retained even with 95% fewer labels. Notably, with self-supervised pre-training and using only 5% labels, the performance drops are minimal: 5.9% for UNet, 4.5% for MDS1, and 6.2% for UDAGAN, compared to their respective fully supervised counterparts (without pre-training, using 100% labels).

While there have been great advances in visual representation learning, such advances have focused on building better representations for a small number of discrete objects bereft of an understanding of how these objects are interacting. One can observe this limitation in representations learned through captions or contrastive learning -- where the learned model treats an image essentially as a bag of words. Several works have attempted to address this limitation through the development of bespoke learned architectures to directly address the shortcomings in compositional learning. In this work, we focus on simple, and scalable approaches. In particular, we demonstrate that by substantially improving weakly labeled data, i.e. captions, we can vastly improve the performance of standard contrastive learning approaches. Previous CLIP models achieved near chance rate on challenging tasks probing compositional learning. However, our simple approach boosts performance of CLIP substantially and surpasses all bespoke architectures. Furthermore, we showcase our results on a relatively new captioning benchmark derived from DOCCI. We demonstrate through a series of ablations that a standard CLIP model trained with enhanced data may demonstrate impressive performance on image retrieval tasks.",

However, current methods still struggle to reconstruct high-quality surfaces from only sparse view input images using Gaussian splatting. In this paper, we propose a novel method called SolidGS to address this problem. We observed that the reconstructed geometry can be severely inconsistent across multi-views, due to the property of Gaussian function in geometry rendering. This motivates us to consolidate all Gaussians by adopting a more solid kernel function, which effectively improves the surface reconstruction quality. With the additional help of geometrical regularization and monocular normal estimation, our method achieves superior performance on the sparse view surface reconstruction than all the Gaussian splatting methods and neural field methods on the widely used DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, and LLFF datasets.",

While an individual LUT does not incur a high memory overhead, software and devices may need to store dozens to hundreds of LUTs that can take over 100 MB. This work aims to develop a neural network architecture that can encode hundreds of LUTs in a single compact representation. To this end, we propose a model with a memory footprint of less than 0.25 MB that can reconstruct 512 LUTs with only minor color distortion ($\\bar{\\Delta}E_M$ $\\leq$ 2.0) over the entire color gamut. We also show that our network can weight colors to provide further quality gains on natural image colors ($\\bar{\\Delta}{E}_M$ $\\leq$ 1.0).

Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time, photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.",

Previous studies in long-tailed recognition have attempted to rebalance biased learning using known sample distributions, primarily addressing different classification difficulties at the class level. However, these approaches often overlook the instance difficulty variation within each class. In this paper, we propose a difficulty-aware balancing margin (DBM) loss, which considers both class imbalance and instance difficulty. DBM loss comprises two components: a class-wise margin to mitigate learning bias caused by imbalanced class frequencies, and an instance-wise margin assigned to hard positive samples based on their individual difficulty. DBM loss improves class discriminativity by assigning larger margins to more difficult samples. Our method seamlessly combines with existing approaches and consistently improves performance across various long-tailed recognition benchmarks.",

To address this issue, we propose a multiagent approach that leverages LLM-MLLM collaboration to correct given captions. Additionally, we introduce an evaluation framework and a benchmark dataset to facilitate the systematic analysis of detailed captions. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed evaluation method better aligns with human judgments of factuality than existing metrics and that existing approaches to improve the MLLM factuality may fall short in hyper-detailed image captioning tasks. In contrast, our proposed method significantly enhances the factual accuracy of captions, even improving those generated by GPT-4V. Finally, we highlight a limitation of VQA-centric benchmarking by demonstrating that an MLLM's performance on VQA benchmarks may not correlate with its ability to generate detailed image captions.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15491v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recently, 3D generative domain adaptation has emerged to adapt the pre-trained generator to other domains without collecting massive datasets and camera pose distributions. Typically, they leverage large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to synthesize images for the target domain and then fine-tune the 3D model. However, they suffer from the tedious pipeline of data generation, which inevitably introduces pose bias between the source domain and synthetic dataset. Furthermore, they are not generalized to support one-shot image-guided domain adaptation, which is more challenging due to the more severe pose bias and additional identity bias introduced by the single image reference. To address these issues, we propose GCA-3D, a generalized and consistent 3D domain adaptation method without the intricate pipeline of data generation. Different from previous pipeline methods, we introduce multi-modal depth-aware score distillation sampling loss to efficiently adapt 3D generative models in a non-adversarial manner. This multi-modal loss enables GCA-3D in both text prompt and one-shot image prompt adaptation. Besides, it leverages per-instance depth maps from the volume rendering module to mitigate the overfitting problem and retain the diversity of results. To enhance the pose and identity consistency, we further propose a hierarchical spatial consistency loss to align the spatial structure between the generated images in the source and target domain. Experiments demonstrate that GCA-3D outperforms previous methods in terms of efficiency, generalization, pose accuracy, and identity consistency.",

ChangeDiff innovatively generates change data in two steps: first, it uses text prompts and a text-to-layout (T2L) model to create continuous layouts, and then it employs layout-to-image (L2I) to convert these layouts into images. Specifically, we propose multi-class distribution-guided text prompts (MCDG-TP), allowing for layouts to be generated flexibly through controllable classes and their corresponding ratios. Subsequently, to generalize the T2L model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is further designed as training supervision. %For the former, a multi-classdistribution-guided text prompt (MCDG-TP) is proposed to complement via controllable classes and ratios. To generalize the text-to-image diffusion model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is designed as training supervision. For the latter, MCDG-TP in three modes is proposed to synthesize new layout masks from various texts. Our generated data shows significant progress in temporal continuity, spatial diversity, and quality realism, empowering change detectors with accuracy and transferability.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15550v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS) has gained popularity due to its faster rendering speed and high-quality novel view synthesis. Some researchers have explored using 3D GS for reconstructing driving scenes. However, these methods often rely on various data types, such as depth maps, 3D boxes, and trajectories of moving objects. Additionally, the lack of annotations for synthesized images limits their direct application in downstream tasks. To address these issues, we propose EGSRAL, a 3D GS-based method that relies solely on training images without extra annotations. EGSRAL enhances 3D GS's capability to model both dynamic objects and static backgrounds and introduces a novel adaptor for auto labeling, generating corresponding annotations based on existing annotations. We also propose a grouping strategy for vanilla 3D GS to address perspective issues in rendering large-scale, complex scenes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without any extra annotation. For example, the PSNR metric reaches 29.04 on the nuScenes dataset. Moreover, our automated labeling can significantly improve the performance of 2D/3D detection tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/jiangxb98/EGSRAL.",

The modality gap between images and point clouds poses significant challenges for cross-modality fusion. Current cross-modality global localization solutions either require modality unification, which leads to information loss, or rely on engineered training schemes to encode multi-modality features, which often lack feature alignment and relation consistency. To address these limitations, we propose, SaliencyI2PLoc, a novel contrastive learning based architecture that fuses the saliency map into feature aggregation and maintains the feature relation consistency on multi-manifold spaces. To alleviate the pre-process of data mining, the contrastive learning framework is applied which efficiently achieves cross-modality feature mapping. The context saliency-guided local feature aggregation module is designed, which fully leverages the contribution of the stationary information in the scene generating a more representative global feature. Furthermore, to enhance the cross-modality feature alignment during contrastive learning, the consistency of relative relationships between samples in different manifold spaces is also taken into account. Experiments conducted on urban and highway scenario datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Specifically, our method achieves a Recall@1 of 78.92% and a Recall@20 of 97.59% on the urban scenario evaluation dataset, showing an improvement of 37.35% and 18.07%, compared to the baseline method. This demonstrates that our architecture efficiently fuses images and point clouds and represents a significant step forward in cross-modality global localization.

Recent schemes have implemented differential privacy to protect face datasets. However, these schemes generally treat each image as a separate database, which does not fully meet the core requirements of differential privacy. In this paper, we propose a semantic-level differential privacy protection scheme that applies to the entire face dataset. Unlike pixel-level differential privacy approaches, our scheme guarantees that semantic privacy in faces is not compromised. The key idea is to convert unstructured data into structured data to enable the application of differential privacy. Specifically, we first extract semantic information from the face dataset to build an attribute database, then apply differential perturbations to obscure this attribute data, and finally use an image synthesis model to generate a protected face dataset. Extensive experimental results show that our scheme can maintain visual naturalness and balance the privacy-utility trade-off compared to the mainstream schemes.",

Radio frequency data with rich semantic information are attracting more and more attention. Most current radar-based models take radio frequency image sequences as the input. However, these models heavily rely on convolutional neural networks and leave out the spatial-temporal semantic context during the encoding stage. To solve these problems, we propose a model called Mask-RadarNet to fully utilize the hierarchical semantic features from the input radar data. Mask-RadarNet exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and attention operations to replace the traditional architecture in transformer-based models. In addition, patch shift is introduced to the Mask-RadarNet for efficient spatial-temporal feature learning. By shifting part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, Mask-RadarNet achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational burden of the spatial-temporal modeling. In order to capture the spatial-temporal semantic contextual information, we design the class masking attention module (CMAM) in our encoder. Moreover, a lightweight auxiliary decoder is added to our model to aggregate prior maps generated from the CMAM. Experiments on the CRUW dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to some state-of-the-art radar-based object detection algorithms. With relatively lower computational complexity and fewer parameters, the proposed Mask-RadarNet achieves higher recognition accuracy for object detection in autonomous driving.",

Existing methods try to solve this issue by reducing the deviation of data distribution, however, they ignore the existence of label deviation in the data due to the acquisition mechanism of the gaze label and the individual physiological differences. In this paper, we first point out that the influence brought by the label deviation cannot be ignored, and propose a gaze label alignment algorithm (GLA) to eliminate the label distribution deviation. Specifically, we first train the feature extractor on all domains to get domain invariant features, and then select an anchor domain to train the gaze regressor. We predict the gaze label on remaining domains and use a mapping function to align the labels. Finally, these aligned labels can be used to train gaze estimation models. Therefore, our method can be combined with any existing method. Experimental results show that our GLA method can effectively alleviate the label distribution shift, and SOTA gaze estimation methods can be further improved obviously.",

Our approach leverages an encoder-decoder architecture, consisting of both domain-invariant and domain-specific parameters. The encoder learns shared crack features across all domains, ensuring robustness to domain variations. Simultaneously, the decoder's domain-specific parameters capture domain-specific features unique to each domain. By combining these components, our model achieves improved crack segmentation performance. Furthermore, we introduce BuildCrack, a new crack dataset comparable to sub-datasets of the well-established CrackSeg9K dataset in terms of image count and crack percentage. We evaluate our proposed approach against state-of-the-art UDA methods using different sub-datasets of CrackSeg9K and our custom dataset.

Existing models often fall short, either by assuming flat terrain or lacking the ability to control motion semantics through text. To address these limitations, we introduce SCENIC, a diffusion model designed to generate human motion that adapts to dynamic terrains within virtual scenes while enabling semantic control through natural language. The key technical challenge lies in simultaneously reasoning about complex scene geometry while maintaining text control. This requires understanding both high-level navigation goals and fine-grained environmental constraints. The model must ensure physical plausibility and precise navigation across varied terrain, while also preserving user-specified text control, such as ``carefully stepping over obstacles\" or ``walking upstairs like a zombie.\" Our solution introduces a hierarchical scene reasoning approach. At its core is a novel scene-dependent, goal-centric canonicalization that handles high-level goal constraint, and is complemented by an ego-centric distance field that captures local geometric details. This dual representation enables our model to generate physically plausible motion across diverse 3D scenes. By implementing frame-wise text alignment, our system achieves seamless transitions between different motion styles while maintaining scene constraints. Experiments demonstrate our novel diffusion model generates arbitrarily long human motions that both adapt to complex scenes with varying terrain surfaces and respond to textual prompts.

Although previous works have made decent success, they are ineffective for real-world challenging applications since these methods simply regard all unlabeled data as OOD data and ignore the case that different datasets have different label granularity. For example, \"cat\" on CIFAR-10 and \"tabby cat\" on Tiny-ImageNet share the same semantics but have different labels due to various label granularity. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Hierarchical Graph Cut network (AHGC) to deeply explore the semantic relationship between different images. Specifically, we construct a hierarchical KNN graph to evaluate the similarities between different images based on the cosine similarity. Based on the linkage and density information of the graph, we cut the graph into multiple subgraphs to integrate these semantics-similar samples. If the labeled percentage in a subgraph is larger than a threshold, we will assign the label with the highest percentage to unlabeled images. To further improve the model generalization, we augment each image into two augmentation versions, and maximize the similarity between the two versions. Finally, we leverage the similarity score for OOD detection. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks (CIFAR- 10 and CIFAR-100) illustrate that in representative cases, AHGC outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods by 81.24% on CIFAR-100 and by 40.47% on CIFAR-10 in terms of \"FPR95\", which shows the effectiveness of our AHGC.",

Although previous respectable TSG methods have achieved remarkable success, they train each video-query pair separately and ignore the relationship between different pairs. We observe that the similar video/query content not only helps the TSG model better understand and generalize the cross-modal representation but also assists the model in locating some complex video-query pairs. Previous methods follow a single-thread framework that cannot co-train different pairs and usually spends much time re-obtaining redundant knowledge, limiting their real-world applications.

Firstly, we mine the spatial and temporal semantics across different queries to cooperate with each other. To learn intra- and inter-modal representations simultaneously, we design a cross-modal contrast module to explore the semantic consistency by a self-supervised strategy. To fully align visual and textual representations between different pairs, we design a prototype alignment strategy to 1) match object prototypes and phrase prototypes for spatial alignment, and 2) align activity prototypes and sentence prototypes for temporal alignment.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15691v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal tracking has garnered widespread attention as a result of its ability to effectively address the inherent limitations of traditional RGB tracking. However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15734v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The biological brain has inspired multiple advances in machine learning. However, most state-of-the-art models in computer vision do not operate like the human brain, simply because they are not capable of changing or improving their decisions/outputs based on a deeper analysis. The brain is recurrent, while these models are not. It is therefore relevant to explore what would be the impact of adding recurrent mechanisms to existing state-of-the-art architectures and to answer the question of whether recurrency can improve existing architectures. To this end, we build on a feed-forward segmentation model and explore multiple types of recurrency for image segmentation. We explore self-organizing, relational, and memory retrieval types of recurrency that minimize a specific energy function. In our experiments, we tested these models on artificial and medical imaging data, while analyzing the impact of high levels of noise and few-shot learning settings. Our results do not validate our initial hypothesis that recurrent models should perform better in these settings, suggesting that these recurrent architectures, by themselves, are not sufficient to surpass state-of-the-art feed-forward versions and that additional work needs to be done on the topic.",

This phenomenon, also known as ``hallucinations\" can have serious downstream implications during the deployment of LVLMs. To address this, we present VORD a simple and effective method that alleviates hallucinations by calibrating token predictions based on ordinal relationships between modified image pairs. VORD is presented in two forms: 1.) a minimalist training-free variant which eliminates implausible tokens from modified image pairs, and 2.) a trainable objective function that penalizes unlikely tokens. Our experiments demonstrate that VORD delivers better calibration and effectively mitigates object hallucinations on a wide-range of LVLM benchmarks.",

Therefore, it is feasible to utilize data from other sensors to facilitate image compression. However, few techniques have explored the potential benefits of utilizing inter-modality correlations to enhance the image compression performance. In this paper, motivated by the recent success of learned image compression, we propose a new framework that uses sparse point clouds to assist in learned image compression in the autonomous driving scenario. We first project the 3D sparse point cloud onto a 2D plane, resulting in a sparse depth map. Utilizing this depth map, we proceed to predict camera images. Subsequently, we use these predicted images to extract multi-scale structural features. These features are then incorporated into learned image compression pipeline as additional information to improve the compression performance. Our proposed framework is compatible with various mainstream learned image compression models, and we validate our approach using different existing image compression methods. The experimental results show that incorporating point cloud assistance into the compression pipeline consistently enhances the performance.",

Representative GFSS approaches typically employ a two-phase training scheme, involving base class pre-training followed by novel class fine-tuning, to learn the classifiers for base and novel classes respectively. Nevertheless, distribution gap exists between base and novel classes in this process. To narrow this gap, we exploit effective knowledge transfer from base to novel classes. First, a novel prototype modulation module is designed to modulate novel class prototypes by exploiting the correlations between base and novel classes. Second, a novel classifier calibration module is proposed to calibrate the weight distribution of the novel classifier according to that of the base classifier. Furthermore, existing GFSS approaches suffer from a lack of contextual information for novel classes due to their limited samples, we thereby introduce a context consistency learning scheme to transfer the contextual knowledge from base to novel classes.

We present a method for curating large-scale image datasets of invertebrates that contain multiple images of the same taxa and/or specimens and have relatively uniform background in the images. Our approach is based on extracting feature embeddings with pretrained deep neural networks, and using these embeddings to find visually most distinct images by comparing their embeddings to the group prototype embedding.

However, most of mainstream Transformer-based ones confronted with dilemma between model capabilities and computation burdens, since self-attention mechanism quadratically increase in computational complexity with respect to image size, and has inadequacies in capturing long-range dependencies. Most of Mamba-related ones solely scanned feature map in spatial dimension for global modeling, failing to fully utilize information in channel dimension. To address aforementioned problems, this paper has proposed to fully utilize complementary advantages from Mamba and Transformer without sacrificing computation efficiency. Specifically, the selective scanning mechanism of Mamba is employed to focus on spatial modeling, enabling capture long-range spatial dependencies under linear complexity. The self-attention mechanism of Transformer is applied to focus on channel modeling, avoiding high computation burdens that are in quadratic growth with image's spatial dimensions. Moreover, to enrich informative prompts for effective image restoration, multi-dimensional prompt learning modules are proposed to learn prompt-flows from multi-scale encoder/decoder layers, benefiting for revealing underlying characteristic of various degradations from both spatial and channel perspectives, therefore, enhancing the capabilities of \"all-in-one\" model to solve various restoration tasks. Extensive experiment results on several image restoration benchmark tasks such as image denoising, dehazing, and deraining, have demonstrated that the proposed method can achieve new state-of-the-art performance, compared with many popular mainstream methods.

An important application of HTG is the generation of training images in order to adapt downstream models for new data sets. With their success in natural image generation, diffusion models (DMs) have become the state-of-the-art approach in HTG. In this work, we present an extension of a latent DM for HTG to enable generation of writing styles not seen during training by learning style conditioning with a masked auto encoder.

However, they underperform in novel situations, limiting their generalisability to clinical populations with pathological movement patterns. Clinical datasets are not widely available for AI training due to ethical challenges and a lack of data collection. We observe that data from other species may be able to bridge this gap by exposing the network to a broader range of motion cues. We found that utilising data from other species and undertaking transfer learning improved human pose estimation in terms of precision and recall compared to the benchmark, which was trained on humans only. Compared to the benchmark, fewer human training examples were needed for the transfer learning approach (1,000 vs 19,185).

Furthermore, only a few labeled instances (1% of the training set) suffice to achieve an accuracy of 92.2%, enabling usage in low-label and thus low-resource scenarios. Our model can be used to correct data entry mistakes: a follow-up analysis of the test set errors of our best-performing single model by an expert radiologist identified 35% incorrect labels and 11% out-of-domain images.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.16028v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted significant attention for its high-quality novel view rendering, inspiring research to address real-world challenges. While conventional methods depend on sharp images for accurate scene reconstruction, real-world scenarios are often affected by defocus blur due to finite depth of field, making it essential to account for realistic 3D scene representation. In this study, we propose CoCoGaussian, a Circle of Confusion-aware Gaussian Splatting that enables precise 3D scene representation using only defocused images. CoCoGaussian addresses the challenge of defocus blur by modeling the Circle of Confusion (CoC) through a physically grounded approach based on the principles of photographic defocus. Exploiting 3D Gaussians, we compute the CoC diameter from depth and learnable aperture information, generating multiple Gaussians to precisely capture the CoC shape. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable scaling factor to enhance robustness and provide more flexibility in handling unreliable depth in scenes with reflective or refractive surfaces. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that CoCoGaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.16039v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in text-to-image (T2I) tasks, leading to their widespread use. With the introduction of classifier-free guidance (CFG), the quality of images generated by DMs is improved. However, DMs can generate more harmful images by maliciously guiding the image generation process through CFG. Some safe guidance methods aim to mitigate the risk of generating harmful images but often reduce the quality of clean image generation. To address this issue, we introduce the Harmful Guidance Redirector (HGR), which redirects harmful CFG direction while preserving clean CFG direction during image generation, transforming CFG into SafeCFG and achieving high safety and quality generation. We train HGR to redirect multiple harmful CFG directions simultaneously, demonstrating its ability to eliminate various harmful elements while preserving high-quality generation. Additionally, we find that HGR can detect image harmfulness, allowing for unsupervised fine-tuning of safe diffusion models without pre-defined clean or harmful labels. Experimental results show that by incorporating HGR, images generated by diffusion models achieve both high quality and strong safety, and safe DMs trained through unsupervised methods according to the harmfulness detected by HGR also exhibit good safety performance.

However, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, which are responsible for modeling token-wise relationships, results in significant latency when generating high-resolution images. To address this issue, we aim at a linear attention mechanism in this paper that reduces the complexity of pre-trained DiTs to linear. We begin our exploration with a comprehensive summary of existing efficient attention mechanisms and identify four key factors crucial for successful linearization of pre-trained DiTs: locality, formulation consistency, high-rank attention maps, and feature integrity. Based on these insights, we introduce a convolution-like local attention strategy termed CLEAR, which limits feature interactions to a local window around each query token, and thus achieves linear complexity. Our experiments indicate that, by fine-tuning the attention layer on merely 10K self-generated samples for 10K iterations, we can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained DiT to a student model with linear complexity, yielding results comparable to the teacher model. Simultaneously, it reduces attention computations by 99.5% and accelerates generation by 6.3 times for generating 8K-resolution images.

Invertible deformable registration, which computes a deformation field and handles complex, non-linear transformation, is essential for tracking anatomical variations, especially in neuroimaging applications where inter-subject differences and longitudinal changes are key. Analyzing the deformation fields is challenging due to their non-linearity, limiting statistical analysis. However, traditional approaches for analyzing deformation fields are computationally expensive, sensitive to initialization, and prone to numerical errors, especially when the deformation is far from the identity. To address these limitations, we propose the Log-Euclidean Diffeomorphic Autoencoder (LEDA), an innovative framework designed to compute the principal logarithm of deformation fields by efficiently predicting consecutive square roots. LEDA operates within a linearized latent space that adheres to the diffeomorphisms group action laws, enhancing our model's robustness and applicability. We also introduce a loss function to enforce inverse consistency, ensuring accurate latent representations of deformation fields.

For the production of such vehicles as a commodity, affordable sensing solutions and reliable localization algorithms must be designed. This work considers scenarios where the sensor data comes from images captured by an inexpensive camera mounted on the vehicle and where the vehicle contains a fine global map. Such localization algorithms typically involve finding the section in the global map that best matches the captured image. In harsh environments, both the global map and the captured image can be noisy. Because of physical constraints on camera placement, the image captured by the camera can be viewed as a noisy perspective transformed version of the road in the global map. Thus, an optimal algorithm should take into account the unequal noise power in various regions of the captured image, and the intrinsic uncertainty in the global map due to environmental variations. This article briefly reviews two matching methods: (i) standard inner product (SIP) and (ii) normalized mutual information (NMI). It then proposes novel and principled modifications to improve the performance of these algorithms significantly in noisy environments. These enhancements are inspired by the physical constraints associated with autonomous vehicles. They are grounded in statistical signal processing and, in some context, are provably better. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of such modifications.",

This constrains their ability to appropriately model the spatially-dependent characteristics of visual inputs. In this paper, we address these limitations by re-deriving modern selective state-space techniques, starting from a natively multidimensional formulation. Currently, prior works attempt to apply natively 1D SSMs to 2D data (i.e. images) by relying on arbitrary combinations of 1D scan directions to capture spatial dependencies. In contrast, Mamba2D improves upon this with a single 2D scan direction that factors in both dimensions of the input natively, effectively modelling spatial dependencies when constructing hidden states.

Monitoring the distribution and abundance of seagrass is essential for environmental impact assessments and conservation efforts. However, the current manual methods of analyzing underwater video transects to assess seagrass coverage are time-consuming and subjective. This work explores the use of deep learning models to automate the process of seagrass detection and coverage estimation from underwater video data. A dataset of over 8,300 annotated underwater images was created, and several deep learning architectures, including ResNet, InceptionNetV3, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer, were evaluated for the task of binary classification of ``Eelgrass Present'' and ``Eelgrass Absent'' images. The results demonstrate that deep learning models, particularly the Vision Transformer, can achieve high performance in predicting eelgrass presence, with AUROC scores exceeding 0.95 on the final test dataset. The use of transfer learning and the application of the Deep WaveNet underwater image enhancement model further improved the models' capabilities. The proposed methodology allows for the efficient processing of large volumes of video data, enabling the acquisition of much more detailed information on seagrass distributions compared to current manual methods.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.16158v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Monolithic VLMs, which avoid modality-specific encoders, offer a promising alternative to the compositional ones but face the challenge of inferior performance. Most existing monolithic VLMs require tuning pre-trained LLMs to acquire vision abilities, which may degrade their language capabilities. To address this dilemma, this paper presents a novel high-performance monolithic VLM named HoVLE. We note that LLMs have been shown capable of interpreting images, when image embeddings are aligned with text embeddings. The challenge for current monolithic VLMs actually lies in the lack of a holistic embedding module for both vision and language inputs. Therefore, HoVLE introduces a holistic embedding module that converts visual and textual inputs into a shared space, allowing LLMs to process images in the same way as texts. Furthermore, a multi-stage training strategy is carefully designed to empower the holistic embedding module. It is first trained to distill visual features from a pre-trained vision encoder and text embeddings from the LLM, enabling large-scale training with unpaired random images and text tokens. The whole model further undergoes next-token prediction on multi-modal data to align the embeddings. Finally, an instruction-tuning stage is incorporated. Our experiments show that HoVLE achieves performance close to leading compositional models on various benchmarks, outperforming previous monolithic models by a large margin.

However, finding the right information, locating the correct forms and filling them out can be challenging for laypeople. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a powerful technology that has the potential to address this gap, but still rely on the user to provide the correct information, which may be challenging and error-prone if the information is only available in complex paper documents. We present an investigation into utilizing multi-modal LLMs to analyze images of handwritten paper forms, in order to automatically extract relevant information in a structured format. Our initial results are promising, but reveal some limitations (e.g., when the image quality is low). Our work demonstrates the potential of integrating multi-modal LLMs to support laypeople and self-represented litigants in finding and assembling relevant information.",

Unlike most loss functions and metrics in machine learning, uncertainty pertains to individual samples, but validating it on individual samples is unfeasible. When validated collectively, it cannot fully represent individual sample properties, posing a challenge in calibrating model confidence in a limited data set. Hence, it is crucial to consider confidence calibration characteristics. To counter the adverse effects of the gradual amplification of the classifier output amplitude in supervised learning, we introduce a post-processing parametric calibration method, $\\rho$-Norm Scaling, which expands the calibrator expression and mitigates overconfidence due to excessive amplitude while preserving accuracy. Moreover, bin-level objective-based calibrator optimization often results in the loss of significant instance-level information. Therefore, we include probability distribution regularization, which incorporates specific priori information that the instance-level uncertainty distribution after calibration should resemble the distribution before calibration. Experimental results demonstrate the substantial enhancement in the post-processing calibrator for uncertainty calibration with our proposed method.",

In this work, we introduce Dynamic Cardiac Reconstruction Attention Network (DCRA-Net) - a novel deep learning model that employs attention mechanisms in spatial and temporal domains and temporal frequency representation of data to reconstruct the dynamics of the fetal heart from highly accelerated free-running (non-gated) MRI acquisitions. DCRA-Net was trained on retrospectively undersampled complex-valued cardiac MRIs from 42 fetal subjects and separately from 153 adult subjects, and evaluated on data from 14 fetal and 39 adult subjects respectively. Its performance was compared to L+S and k-GIN methods in both fetal and adult cases for an undersampling factor of 8x. The proposed network performed better than the comparators for both fetal and adult data, for both regular lattice and centrally weighted random undersampling. Aliased signals due to the undersampling were comprehensively resolved, and both the spatial details of the heart and its temporal dynamics were recovered with high fidelity. The highest performance was achieved when using lattice undersampling, data consistency and temporal frequency representation, yielding PSNR of 38 for fetal and 35 for adult cases.

Encoder-decoder networks have emerged as a promising solution for these tasks. However, training of these networks has typically required full boundary annotations of cells, which are labor-intensive and difficult to obtain on a large scale. However, in many applications, such as cell counting, weaker forms of annotations--such as point annotations or approximate cell counts--can provide sufficient supervision for training. This study proposes a new mixed-supervision approach for training multitask networks in digital pathology by incorporating cell counts derived from the eyeballing process--a quick visual estimation method commonly used by pathologists. This study has two main contributions: (1) It proposes a mixed-supervision strategy for digital pathology that utilizes cell counts obtained by eyeballing as an auxiliary supervisory signal to train a multitask network for the first time. (2) This multitask network is designed to concurrently learn the tasks of cell counting and cell localization, and this study introduces a consistency loss that regularizes training by penalizing inconsistencies between the predictions of these two tasks. Our experiments on two datasets of hematoxylin-eosin stained tissue images demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively utilizes the weakest form of annotation, improving performance when stronger annotations are limited. These results highlight the potential of integrating eyeballing-derived ground truths into the network training, reducing the need for resource-intensive annotations.",

However, this paradigm suffers from major limitations compared to deep models, such as lower performance. This led to the development of the so-called deep Prototype-Based Networks (PBNs), also known as prototypical parts models. In this work, we analyze these models with respect to different properties, including interpretability. In particular, we focus on the Classification-by-Components (CBC) approach, which uses a probabilistic model to ensure interpretability and can be used as a shallow or deep architecture. We show that this model has several shortcomings, like creating contradicting explanations. Based on these findings, we propose an extension of CBC that solves these issues. Moreover, we prove that this extension has robustness guarantees and derive a loss that optimizes robustness. Additionally, our analysis shows that most (deep) PBNs are related to (deep) RBF classifiers, which implies that our robustness guarantees generalize to shallow RBF classifiers. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that our deep PBN yields state-of-the-art classification accuracy on different benchmarks while resolving the interpretability shortcomings of other approaches. Further, our shallow PBN variant outperforms other shallow PBNs while being inherently interpretable and exhibiting provable robustness guarantees.",

One example of design manipulation involves taking two reference design images and using them as prompts to generate a design image that combines aspects of both. Real engineering designs have physical constraints and functional requirements in addition to aesthetic design considerations. Internet-scale foundation models commonly used for image generation, however, are unable to take these physical constraints and functional requirements into consideration as part of the generation process. We consider the problem of generating a design inspired by two input designs, and propose a zero-shot framework toward enforcing physical, functional requirements over the generation process by leveraging a pretrained diffusion model as the backbone. As a case study, we consider the example of rotational symmetry in generation of wheel designs. Automotive wheels are required to be rotationally symmetric for physical stability. We formulate the requirement of rotational symmetry by the use of a symmetrizer, and we use this symmetrizer to guide the diffusion process towards symmetric wheel generations. Our experimental results find that the proposed approach makes generated interpolations with higher realism than methods in related work, as evaluated by Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID).

It provides a single concise index for an estimate of resources required for retraining the model. Through extensive experiments, we show that RESQUE has a strong correlation with various retraining measures.

These measures align well with RESQUE for new tasks, multiple noise types, and varying noise intensities. As a result, RESQUE enables users to make informed decisions for retraining to different tasks/distribution shifts and determine the most cost-effective and sustainable option, allowing for the reuse of a model with a much smaller footprint in the environment.

On this basis, we incorporate advanced physics-based underwater imaging estimation into our method and define distortion metrics that measure the impact of direct transmission attenuation and backwards scattering on image quality. Second, acknowledging the significant content differences across various regions of an image and the varying perceptual sensitivity to distortions in these regions, we design a local perceptual module on the basis of the neighborhood attention mechanism. This module effectively captures subtle features in images, thereby enhancing the adaptive perception of distortions on the basis of local information. Finally, by employing a global perceptual module to further integrate the original image content with underwater image distortion information, the proposed model can accurately predict the image quality score. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PIGUIQA achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image quality prediction and exhibits strong generalizability.

We further introduce a hierarchical reward synthesis approach that combines CLG-based semantic rewards with vehicle state information, improving reward stability and offering a more comprehensive reward signal. Additionally, a batch-processing technique is employed to optimize computational efficiency during training. Extensive experiments in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that VLM-RL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 10.5\\% reduction in collision rate, a 104.6\\% increase in route completion rate, and robust generalization to unseen driving scenarios.

Despite numerous proposed methods, these issues remain persistent obstacles. This paper proposes a novel CIL method, called Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA), that can effectively avoid CF and ICS problems.

When a new task arrives, KLDA computes only the mean for each class in the task and updates a shared covariance matrix for all learned classes based on the kernelized features. Classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our empirical evaluation using text and image classification datasets demonstrates that KLDA significantly outperforms baselines.

A wide range of regularization methods has been proposed for both conventional and deep learning-based registration. However, the appropriate application of regularization techniques often depends on the specific registration problem, and no one-fits-all method exists. Despite its importance, regularization is often overlooked or addressed with default approaches, assuming existing methods are sufficient. A comprehensive and structured review remains missing. This review addresses this gap by introducing a novel taxonomy that systematically categorizes the diverse range of proposed regularization methods. It highlights the emerging field of learned regularization, which leverages data-driven techniques to automatically derive deformation properties from the data. Moreover, this review examines the transfer of regularization methods from conventional to learning-based registration, identifies open challenges, and outlines future research directions. By emphasizing the critical role of regularization in image registration, we hope to inspire the research community to reconsider regularization strategies in modern registration algorithms and to explore this rapidly evolving field further.",

Predictive Gradient Boosted Trees based on clinical data have attempted to optimize ICU admission by identifying key risk factors pre-operatively; however, these approaches overlook valuable imaging data that could enhance prediction accuracy. In this work, we show that multimodal approaches that combine clinical data with imaging data outperform the current clinical data only baseline from 0.29 [F1] to 0.30 [F1], when only pre-operative clinical data is used and from 0.37 [F1] to 0.41 [F1], for pre- and post-operative data.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.15847v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Current full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) methods often fuse features from reference and distorted images, overlooking that color and luminance distortions occur mainly at low frequencies, whereas edge and texture distortions occur at high frequencies. This work introduces a pioneering training-free FR-IQA method that accurately predicts image quality in alignment with the human visual system (HVS) by leveraging a novel perceptual degradation modelling approach to address this limitation. First, a collaborative feature refinement module employs a carefully designed wavelet transform to extract perceptually relevant features, capturing multiscale perceptual information and mimicking how the HVS analyses visual information at various scales and orientations in the spatial and frequency domains. Second, a Hausdorff distance-based distribution similarity measurement module robustly assesses the discrepancy between the feature distributions of the reference and distorted images, effectively handling outliers and variations while mimicking the ability of HVS to perceive and tolerate certain levels of distortion. The proposed method accurately captures perceptual quality differences without requiring training data or subjective quality scores. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its ability to correlate strongly with the HVS.\\footnote{The code is available at \\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CVPR2025-F339}.}",

However, significant data imbalances pose a challenge in this framework. Participants with smaller datasets in distributed learning environments often achieve poorer results than participants with larger datasets. Data imbalances are particularly pronounced in medical fields and are caused by different patient populations, technological inequalities and divergent data collection practices.\n  In this paper, we consider distributed learning as an Stackelberg evolutionary game. We present two algorithms for setting the weights of each node's contribution to the global model in each training round: the Deterministic Stackelberg Weighting Model (DSWM) and the Adaptive Stackelberg Weighting Model (ASWM). We use three medical datasets to highlight the impact of dynamic weighting on underrepresented nodes in distributed learning. Our results show that the ASWM significantly favours underrepresented nodes by improving their performance by 2.713% in AUC.

The presence of pathologies, broken structures or limited field-of-view (FOV) can all make anatomy parsing algorithms vulnerable. In this work, we explore how to leverage and implement the successful detection-then-segmentation paradigm for 3D medical data, and propose a steerable, robust, and efficient computing framework for detection, identification, and segmentation of anatomies in CT scans. Considering the complicated shapes, sizes, and orientations of anatomies, without loss of generality, we present a nine degrees of freedom (9-DoF) pose estimation solution in full 3D space using a novel single-stage, non-hierarchical representation. Our whole framework is executed in a steerable manner where any anatomy of interest can be directly retrieved to further boost inference efficiency. We have validated our method on three medical imaging parsing tasks: ribs, spine, and abdominal organs. For rib parsing, CT scans have been annotated at the rib instance-level for quantitative evaluation, similarly for spine vertebrae and abdominal organs. Extensive experiments on 9-DoF box detection and rib instance segmentation demonstrate the high efficiency and effectiveness of our framework (with the identification rate of 97.0% and the segmentation Dice score of 90.9%), compared favorably against several strong baselines (e.g., CenterNet, FCOS, and nnU-Net).

Such assessment is key to thorough intervention planning and to intraprocedural guidance. However, it requires segmentation from 3DTEE images, which is timeconsuming, operator-dependent, and often merely qualitative. In the present work, a novel workflow to quantify the patient-specific MV geometry from 3DTEE is proposed. The developed approach relies on a 3D multi-decoder residual convolutional neural network (CNN) with a U-Net architecture for multi-class segmentation of MV annulus and leaflets. The CNN was trained and tested on a dataset comprising 55 3DTEE examinations of MR-affected patients. After training, the CNN is embedded into a fully automatic, and hence fully repeatable, pipeline that refines the predicted segmentation, detects MV anatomical landmarks and quantifies MV morphology. The trained 3D CNN achieves an average Dice score of $0.82 \\pm 0.06$, mean surface distance of $0.43 \\pm 0.14$ mm and 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD) of $3.57 \\pm 1.56$ mm before segmentation refinement, outperforming a state-of-the-art baseline residual U-Net architecture, and provides an unprecedented multi-class segmentation of the annulus, anterior and posterior leaflet. The automatic 3D linear morphological measurements of the annulus and leaflets, specifically diameters and lengths, exhibit differences of less than 1.45 mm when compared to ground truth values. These measurements also demonstrate strong overall agreement with analyses conducted by semi-automated commercial software.

In this paper, we propose a benchmark for assessing the robustness of vision-language models. We believe that a robust model should properly understand both linguistic and visual semantics and be resilient to explicit variations. In pursuit of this goal, we create new variants of texts and images in the MS-COCO test set and re-evaluate the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models with the new data. Specifically, we alter the meaning of text by replacing a word, and generate visually altered images that maintain some visual context while introducing noticeable pixel changes through image mixing techniques.Our evaluations on the proposed benchmark reveal substantial performance degradation in many SOTA models (e.g., Image-to-Text Recall@1: 81.9\\% $\\rightarrow$ 48.4\\% in BLIP, 66.1\\% $\\rightarrow$ 37.6\\% in VSE$\\infty$), with the models often favoring the altered texts/images over the original ones.

Modern scene understanding models could empower these people by assisting them with navigation, obstacle avoidance and visual recognition capabilities. The research community needs high quality datasets for both training and evaluation to build these systems. While datasets for autonomous vehicles are abundant, there is a critical gap in datasets tailored for outdoor human navigation. This gap poses a major obstacle to the development of computer vision based Assistive Technologies. To overcome this obstacle, we present SANPO, a large-scale egocentric video dataset designed for dense prediction in outdoor human navigation environments. SANPO contains 701 stereo videos of 30+ seconds captured in diverse real-world outdoor environments across four geographic locations in the USA. Every frame has a high resolution depth map and 112K frames were annotated with temporally consistent dense video panoptic segmentation labels.

Traditional image captioning methods often overlook the preferences and characteristics of users. Personalized image captioning solves this problem by incorporating user prior knowledge into the model, such as writing styles and preferred vocabularies. Most existing methods emphasize the user context fusion process by memory networks or transformers. However, these methods ignore the distinct domains of each dataset. Therefore, they need to update the entire caption model parameters when meeting new samples, which is time-consuming and calculation-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel personalized image captioning framework that leverages user context to consider personality factors. Additionally, our framework utilizes the prefix-tuning paradigm to extract knowledge from a frozen large language model, reducing the gap between different language domains. Specifically, we employ CLIP to extract the visual features of an image and align the semantic space using a query-guided mapping network. By incorporating the transformer layer, we merge the visual features with the user's contextual prior knowledge to generate informative prefixes. Moreover, we employ GPT-2 as the frozen large language model. With a small number of parameters to be trained, our model performs efficiently and effectively.

Current ReID methods assume that the deployed system follows the centralized processing paradigm, i.e., all computations are conducted in the cloud server and edge devices are only used to capture images. As the number of videos experiences a rapid escalation, this paradigm has become impractical due to the finite computational resources in the cloud server. Therefore, the ReID system should be converted to fit in the cloud-edge collaborative processing paradigm, which is crucial to boost its scalability and practicality. However, current works lack relevant research on this important specific issue, making it difficult to adapt them into a cloud-edge framework effectively. In this paper, we propose a cloud-edge collaborative inference framework for ReID systems, aiming to expedite the return of the desired image captured by the camera to the cloud server by learning the spatial-temporal correlations among objects. In the system, a Distribution-aware Correlation Modeling network (DaCM) is particularly proposed to embed the spatial-temporal correlations of the camera network implicitly into a graph structure, and it can be applied 1) in the cloud to regulate the size of the upload window and 2) on the edge device to adjust the sequence of images, respectively. Notably, the proposed DaCM can be seamlessly combined with traditional ReID methods, enabling their application within our proposed edge-cloud collaborative framework.

For the first part, we learn an in-filling diffusion model to hallucinate unseen parts of a person given a single image. We train this model on texture map space, which makes it more sample-efficient since it is invariant to pose and viewpoint. Second, we develop a diffusion-based rendering pipeline, which is controlled by 3D human poses. This produces realistic renderings of novel poses of the person, including clothing, hair, and plausible in-filling of unseen regions. This disentangled approach allows our method to generate a sequence of images that are faithful to the target motion in the 3D pose and, to the input image in terms of visual similarity. In addition to that, the 3D control allows various synthetic camera trajectories to render a person.

Generating nuanced human motion presents two challenges. First, it is non-trivial to learn from multi-modal human and object information derived from both the physical and non-physical attributes. Second, there exists no dataset capturing nuanced human interactions with objects of varying physical properties, hampering model development. This work addresses the gap by introducing the FORCE model, an approach for synthesizing diverse, nuanced human-object interactions by modeling physical attributes.

    "summary": "arXiv:2405.09404v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Contrastive pretraining provides robust representations by ensuring their invariance to different image transformations while simultaneously preventing representational collapse. Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we propose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.07543v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recently, vision model pre-training has evolved from relying on manually annotated datasets to leveraging large-scale, web-crawled image-text data. Despite these advances, there is no pre-training method that effectively exploits the interleaved image-text data, which is very prevalent on the Internet. Inspired by the recent success of compression learning in natural language processing, we propose a novel vision model pre-training method called Latent Compression Learning (LCL) for interleaved image-text data. This method performs latent compression learning by maximizing the mutual information between the inputs and outputs of a causal attention model. The training objective can be decomposed into two basic tasks: 1) contrastive learning between visual representation and preceding context, and 2) generating subsequent text based on visual representation. Our experiments demonstrate that our method not only matches the performance of CLIP on paired pre-training datasets (e.g., LAION), but can also leverage interleaved pre-training data (e.g., MMC4) to learn robust visual representation from scratch, showcasing the potential of vision model pre-training with interleaved image-text data.

However, this many-shot multimodal ICL setting has one crucial problem: it is fundamentally limited by the model's context length set at pretraining. The problem is especially prominent in the multimodal domain, which processes both text and images, requiring additional tokens. This motivates the need for a multimodal method to compress many shots into fewer tokens without finetuning. In this work, we enable LMMs to perform multimodal, many-shot in-context learning by leveraging Multimodal Task Vectors (MTV) -- compact implicit representations of in-context examples compressed in the model's attention heads. Specifically, we first demonstrate the existence of such MTV in LMMs and then leverage these extracted MTV to enable many-shot in-context learning for various vision-and-language tasks. Our experiments suggest that MTV can scale in performance with the number of compressed shots and generalize to similar out-of-domain tasks without additional context length for inference.

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.19391v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Transformer architectures such as Vision Transformers (ViT) have proven effective for solving visual perception tasks. However, they suffer from two major limitations; first, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limits the number of tokens that can be processed, and second, Transformers often require large amounts of training data to attain state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a new multi-head self-attention (MHSA) variant named Fibottention, which can replace MHSA in Transformer architectures. Fibottention is data-efficient and computationally more suitable for processing large numbers of tokens than the standard MHSA. It employs structured sparse attention based on dilated Fibonacci sequences, which, uniquely, differ across attention heads, resulting in inception-like diverse features across heads. The spacing of the Fibonacci sequences follows the Wythoff array, which minimizes the redundancy of token interactions aggregated across different attention heads, while still capturing sufficient complementary information through token pair interactions. These sparse attention patterns are unique among the existing sparse attention and lead to an $O(N \\log N)$ complexity, where $N$ is the number of tokens. Leveraging only 2-6% of the elements in the self-attention heads, Fibottention embedded into popular, state-of-the-art Transformer architectures can achieve significantly improved predictive performance for domains with limited data such as image classification, video understanding, and robot learning tasks, and render reduced computational complexity. We further validated the improved diversity of feature representations resulting from different self-attention heads, and our model design against other sparse attention mechanisms.",

However, recent research indicates that prompt tuning methods often lead to overfitting due to limited training samples. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal Aligned Feature Tuning (Craft) method to address this issue. Cross-modal alignment is conducted by first selecting anchors from the alternative domain and deriving relative representations of the embeddings for the selected anchors. Optimizing for a feature alignment loss over anchor-aligned text and image modalities creates a more unified text-image common space. Overfitting in prompt tuning also deteriorates model performance on out-of-distribution samples. To further improve the prompt model's robustness, we propose minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) over the anchor-aligned feature spaces to mitigate domain shift. The experiment on four different prompt tuning structures consistently shows the improvement of our method, with increases of up to $6.1\\%$ in the Base-to-Novel generalization task, $5.8\\%$ in the group robustness task, and $2.7\\%$ in the out-of-distribution tasks.

The existing hairstyle transfer approaches heavily rely on StyleGAN, which is pre-trained on cropped and aligned face images. Hence, they struggle to generalize under challenging conditions such as extreme variations of head poses or focal lengths. To address this issue, we propose a one-stage hairstyle transfer diffusion model, HairFusion, that applies to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we carefully design a hair-agnostic representation as the input of the model, where the original hair information is thoroughly eliminated. Next, we introduce a hair align cross-attention (Align-CA) to accurately align the reference hairstyle with the face image while considering the difference in their head poses. To enhance the preservation of the face image's original features, we leverage adaptive hair blending during the inference, where the output's hair regions are estimated by the cross-attention map in Align-CA and blended with non-hair areas of the face image. Our experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to the existing methods in preserving the integrity of both the transferred hairstyle and the surrounding features.

Representative methods utilize discrete representation composed of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) template features to suppress pixel-level information redundancy and guide object-level feature aggregation. The most recent advancement, Grouped Discrete Representation (GDR), further decomposes these template features into attributes. However, its naive channel grouping as decomposition may erroneously group channels belonging to different attributes together and discretize them as sub-optimal template attributes, which losses information and harms expressivity. We propose Organized GDR (OGDR) to organize channels belonging to the same attributes together for correct decomposition from features into attributes. In unsupervised segmentation experiments, OGDR is fully superior to GDR in augmentating classical transformer-based OCL methods; it even improves state-of-the-art diffusion-based ones.

This has inspired the rapid development of Mamba-based vision models, resulting in promising results in visual recognition tasks. However, such models are not capable of distilling features across layers through feature aggregation, interaction, and selection. Moreover, existing cross-layer feature aggregation methods designed for CNNs or ViTs are not practical in Mamba-based models due to high computational costs. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce an efficient cross-layer feature aggregation mechanism for vision backbone networks. Inspired by the Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) in the human visual system, we propose a new sparse cross-layer connection mechanism termed SparX to effectively improve cross-layer feature interaction and reuse. Specifically, we build two different types of network layers: ganglion layers and normal layers. The former has higher connectivity and complexity, enabling multi-layer feature aggregation and interaction in an input-dependent manner. In contrast, the latter has lower connectivity and complexity. By interleaving these two types of layers, we design a new family of vision backbone networks with sparsely cross-connected layers, achieving an excellent trade-off among model size, computational cost, memory cost, and accuracy in comparison to its counterparts. For instance, with fewer parameters, SparX-Mamba-T improves the top-1 accuracy of VMamba-T from 82.5\\% to 83.5\\%, while SparX-Swin-T achieves a 1.3\\% increase in top-1 accuracy compared to Swin-T.

Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).",

By integrating multiple anchor points, it reduces the impact of individual heatmap inaccuracies, leading to robust overall positioning. (2) To enhance the pseudo-range accuracy of selected anchor points, a new loss function, named multilateration anchor loss, is proposed. This loss function enhances the accuracy of the distance map, mitigates the risk of local optima, and ensures optimal solutions.

We verify this finding in higher dimensions, where we show that competitive generative performance to state-of-the-art guidance methods can be achieved when the auxiliary model differs from the primary one only by having stronger weight regularization. As an independent contribution, we investigate whether upweighting long-range spatial dependencies improves visual fidelity.

    "title": "GSurf: 3D Reconstruction via Signed Distance Fields with Direct Gaussian Supervision",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.15723v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Surface reconstruction from multi-view images is a core challenge in 3D vision. Recent studies have explored signed distance fields (SDF) within Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to achieve high-fidelity surface reconstructions. However, these approaches often suffer from slow training and rendering speeds compared to 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Current state-of-the-art techniques attempt to fuse depth information to extract geometry from 3DGS, but frequently result in incomplete reconstructions and fragmented surfaces. In this paper, we introduce GSurf, a novel end-to-end method for learning a signed distance field directly from Gaussian primitives. The continuous and smooth nature of SDF addresses common issues in the 3DGS family, such as holes resulting from noisy or missing depth data. By using Gaussian splatting for rendering, GSurf avoids the redundant volume rendering typically required in other GS and SDF integrations. Consequently, GSurf achieves faster training and rendering speeds while delivering 3D reconstruction quality comparable to neural implicit surface methods, such as VolSDF and NeuS. Experimental results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing high-fidelity 3D reconstructions.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.05076v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: This paper studies a combined person reidentification (re-id) method that uses human parsing, analytical feature extraction and similarity estimation schemes. One of its prominent features is its low computational requirements so it can be implemented on edge devices. The method allows direct comparison of specific image regions using interpretable features which consist of color and texture channels. It is proposed to analyze and compare colors in CIE-Lab color space using histogram smoothing for noise reduction. A novel pre-configured latent space (LS) supervised autoencoder (SAE) is proposed for texture analysis which encodes input textures as LS points. This allows to obtain more accurate similarity measures compared to simplistic label comparison. The proposed method also does not rely upon photos or other re-id data for training, which makes it completely re-id dataset-agnostic. The viability of the proposed method is verified by computing rank-1, rank-10, and mAP re-id metrics on Market1501 dataset. The results are comparable to those of conventional deep learning methods and the potential ways to further improve the method are discussed.",

It uses CCTV footage, for example, to record only major events-like the appearance of a person or a thief-so that storage is optimized and digital searches are easier. It utilizes the latest techniques in object detection and tracking, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like YOLO, SSD, and Faster R-CNN, as well as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), to achieve high accuracy in detection and capture temporal dependencies. The approach incorporates adaptive background modeling through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and optical flow methods like Lucas-Kanade to detect motions. Multi-scale and contextual analysis are used to improve detection across different object sizes and environments. A hybrid motion segmentation strategy combines statistical and deep learning models to manage complex movements, while optimizations for real-time processing ensure efficient computation. Tracking methods, such as Kalman Filters and Siamese networks, are employed to maintain smooth tracking even in cases of occlusion. Detection is improved on various-sized objects for multiple scenarios by multi-scale and contextual analysis. Results demonstrate high precision and recall in detecting and tracking objects, with significant improvements in processing times and accuracy due to real-time optimizations and illumination-invariant features.

However, the high computational complexity of mainstream Transformer-based methods limits their application. Recent Mamba demonstrates efficiency in modeling long sequences, but directly applying Mamba to FSAR overlooks the importance of local feature modeling and alignment. Moreover, long sub-sequences within the same class accumulate intra-class variance, which adversely impacts FSAR performance. To solve these challenges, we propose a Matryoshka MAmba and CoNtrasTive LeArning framework (Manta). Firstly, the Matryoshka Mamba introduces multiple Inner Modules to enhance local feature representation, rather than directly modeling global features. An Outer Module captures dependencies of timeline between these local features for implicit temporal alignment. Secondly, a hybrid contrastive learning paradigm, combining both supervised and unsupervised methods, is designed to mitigate the negative effects of intra-class variance accumulation. The Matryoshka Mamba and the hybrid contrastive learning paradigm operate in two parallel branches within Manta, enhancing Mamba for FSAR of long sub-sequence. Manta achieves new state-of-the-art performance on prominent benchmarks, including SSv2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51.

Existing training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) methods often employ a two-stage process: they first generate a caption for the reference image and then use Large Language Models for reasoning to obtain a target description. However, these methods suffer from missing critical visual details and limited reasoning capabilities, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance.

Our Reflective Chain-of-Thought framework further improves interpretative accuracy by aligning manipulation intent with contextual cues from reference images.

Since actions typically occur over a sequence of consecutive images, it is particularly challenging due to the inclusion of temporal analysis, which introduces an extra layer of complexity. However, although multiple approaches try to handle temporal analysis, there are still difficulties because of their computational cost and lack of adaptability. Therefore, different types of vision data, containing transition information between consecutive images, provided by next-generation hardware sensors will guide the robotics community in tackling the problem of human action recognition. On the other hand, while there is a plethora of still-image datasets, that researchers can adopt to train new artificial intelligence models, videos representing human activities are of limited capabilities, e.g., small and unbalanced datasets or selected without control from multiple sources. To this end, generating new and realistic synthetic videos is possible since labeling is performed throughout the data creation process, while reinforcement learning techniques can permit the avoidance of considerable dataset dependence. At the same time, human factors' involvement raises ethical issues for the research community, as doubts and concerns about new technologies already exist.",

The traditional way to calibrate HSI utilizes a physical reference, which involves manual operations, occlusions, and/or limits camera mobility. These limitations inspire this paper to automatically calibrate HSIs using a learning-based method. Towards this goal, a large-scale HSI calibration dataset is created, which has 765 high-quality HSI pairs covering diversified natural scenes and illuminations. The dataset is further expanded to 7650 pairs by combining with 10 different physically measured illuminations. A spectral illumination transformer (SIT) together with an illumination attention module is proposed. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate the SoTA performance of the proposed SIT.

However, assessing the geometric quality of 3D reconstructions in the absence of ground truth mesh remains a significant challenge, due to its rendering-based optimization process and entangled learning of appearance and geometry with photometric losses. In this paper, we present a novel framework, i.e, GURecon, which establishes a geometric uncertainty field for the neural surface based on geometric consistency. Different from existing methods that rely on rendering-based measurement, GURecon models a continuous 3D uncertainty field for the reconstructed surface, and is learned by an online distillation approach without introducing real geometric information for supervision. Moreover, in order to mitigate the interference of illumination on geometric consistency, a decoupled field is learned and exploited to finetune the uncertainty field. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of GURecon in modeling 3D geometric uncertainty, as well as its plug-and-play extension to various neural surface representations and improvement on downstream tasks such as incremental reconstruction.

Recently with the introduction of popular contrastive learning, the consistency learning of views has been further enhanced in MVC, leading to promising performance. However, by contrast, the complementarity has not received sufficient attention except just in the feature facet, where the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion term or the independent encoder-decoder network is usually adopted to capture view-specific information. This motivates us to reconsider the complementarity learning of views comprehensively from multiple facets including the feature-, view-label- and contrast- facets, while maintaining the view consistency. We empirically find that all the facets contribute to the complementarity learning, especially the view-label facet, which is usually neglected by existing methods. Based on this, a simple yet effective \\underline{M}ultifacet \\underline{C}omplementarity learning framework for \\underline{M}ulti-\\underline{V}iew \\underline{C}lustering (MCMVC) is naturally developed, which fuses multifacet complementarity information, especially explicitly embedding the view-label information.

To address this limitation, self-supervised methods have emerged as a viable alternative, leveraging available subsampled $k$-space data to train deep neural networks for MRI reconstruction. Nevertheless, these approaches often fall short when compared to supervised methods. We propose Joint Supervised and Self-supervised Learning (JSSL), a novel training approach for deep learning-based MRI reconstruction algorithms aimed at enhancing reconstruction quality in cases where target datasets containing fully-sampled $k$-space measurements are unavailable. JSSL operates by simultaneously training a model in a self-supervised learning setting, using subsampled data from the target dataset(s), and in a supervised learning manner, utilizing datasets with fully-sampled $k$-space data, referred to as proxy datasets.

Moreover, we include supplementary studies on grayscale natural images and accelerated brain MRI data. The results of all experiments show a similar outcome in line with previous findings for medical images: PSNR and SSIM in the default setting are in the lower range of the result list and HaarPSI outperforms the other tested measures in the overall performance. Also among the top performers in our experiments are the full reference measures FSIM, LPIPS and MS-SSIM.

Three main data selection approaches are: (1) leveraging external non-CLIP models to aid data selection, (2) training new CLIP-style embedding models that are more effective at selecting high-quality data than the original OpenAI CLIP model, and (3) designing better metrics or strategies universally applicable to any CLIP embedding without requiring specific model properties (e.g., CLIPScore is one popular metric). While the first two approaches have been extensively studied, the third remains under-explored. In this paper, we advance the third approach by proposing two new methods. Firstly, instead of classical CLIP scores that only consider the alignment between two modalities from a single sample, we introduce surrogate-CLIPLoss (s-CLIPLoss), a CLIP loss-inspired method that adds the alignment between one sample and its contrastive pairs as an extra normalization term for better quality measurement. Secondly, when downstream tasks are known, we propose a new norm-based metric, NormSim, to measure the similarity between pretraining data and target data.

    "summary": "arXiv:2407.09475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Deep learning-based trajectory prediction models for autonomous driving often struggle with generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, sometimes performing worse than simple rule-based models. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework, Adaptive Prediction Ensemble (APE), which integrates deep learning and rule-based prediction experts. A learned routing function, trained concurrently with the deep learning model, dynamically selects the most reliable prediction based on the input scenario. Our experiments on large-scale datasets, including Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) and Argoverse, demonstrate improvement in zero-shot generalization across datasets. We show that our method outperforms individual prediction models and other variants, particularly in long-horizon prediction and scenarios with a high proportion of OOD data. This work highlights the potential of hybrid approaches for robust and generalizable motion prediction in autonomous driving.

Generally, along with design in advanced Flux\\footnote{https://github.com/black-forest-labs/flux} model, we transfers it into a latent VAE space of mel-spectrum. It involves first applying a sequence of independent attention to the double text-music stream, followed by a stacked single music stream for denoised patch prediction. We employ multiple pre-trained text encoders to sufficiently capture caption semantic information as well as inference flexibility. In between, coarse textual information, in conjunction with time step embeddings, is utilized in a modulation mechanism, while fine-grained textual details are concatenated with the music patch sequence as inputs. Through an in-depth study, we demonstrate that rectified flow training with an optimized architecture significantly outperforms established diffusion methods for the text-to-music task, as evidenced by various automatic metrics and human preference evaluations.

    "title": "A Modern Take on Visual Relationship Reasoning for Grasp Planning",
    "summary": "arXiv:2409.02035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Interacting with real-world cluttered scenes pose several challenges to robotic agents that need to understand complex spatial dependencies among the observed objects to determine optimal pick sequences or efficient object retrieval strategies. Existing solutions typically manage simplified scenarios and focus on predicting pairwise object relationships following an initial object detection phase, but often overlook the global context or struggle with handling redundant and missing object relations. In this work, we present a modern take on visual relational reasoning for grasp planning. We introduce D3GD, a novel testbed that includes bin picking scenes with up to 35 objects from 97 distinct categories. Additionally, we propose D3G, a new end-to-end transformer-based dependency graph generation model that simultaneously detects objects and produces an adjacency matrix representing their spatial relationships. Recognizing the limitations of standard metrics, we employ the Average Precision of Relationships for the first time to evaluate model performance, conducting an extensive experimental benchmark. The obtained results establish our approach as the new state-of-the-art for this task, laying the foundation for future research in robotic manipulation.

In this study, we empirically analyze LVLMs in long-context reasoning, revealing that increased context length leads to a higher dependence on language at the expense of visual dependency. To address this issue, we propose a novel training-free context pruning method that selectively removes less critical textual information. Our approach enhances visual dependency and reduces textual noise, thereby improving LVLM performance in long-context reasoning. We validate our method by constructing a long-context dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness across various LVLMs. Moreover, further analysis confirms the robustness of different token pruning strategies and preliminary explores scaling laws between pruning rates and context length.",

As the complexity of QD devices grows, manual tuning becomes increasingly infeasible, necessitating robust and scalable autotuning solutions. Tuning large arrays of QD qubits depends on efficient choices of automated protocols. Here, we introduce a bootstrapping, autonomous testing, and initialization system (BATIS) designed to streamline QD device evaluation and calibration. BATIS navigates high-dimensional gate voltage spaces, automating essential steps such as leakage testing and gate characterization. For forming the current channels, BATIS follows a non-standard approach that requires a single measurement regardless of the number of channels. Demonstrated at 1.3 K on a quad-QD Si/Si$_x$Ge$_{1-x}$ device, BATIS eliminates the need for deep cryogenic environments during initial device diagnostics, significantly enhancing scalability and reducing setup times. By requiring only minimal prior knowledge of the device architecture, BATIS represents a platform-agnostic solution, adaptable to various QD systems, which bridges a critical gap in QD autotuning.",

First, we provide a GPU-accelerated implementation of the Home Assistant Benchmark (HAB). We support realistic low-level control and achieve over 3x the speed of previous magical grasp implementations at similar GPU memory usage. Second, we train extensive reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL) baselines for future work to compare against.

Our multi-LLM summarization framework has two fundamentally important steps at each round of conversation: generation and evaluation. These steps are different depending on whether our multi-LLM decentralized summarization is used or centralized. In both our multi-LLM decentralized and centralized strategies, we have k different LLMs that generate diverse summaries of the text. However, during evaluation, our multi-LLM centralized summarization approach leverages a single LLM to evaluate the summaries and select the best one whereas k LLMs are used for decentralized multi-LLM summarization. Overall, we find that our multi-LLM summarization approaches significantly outperform the baselines that leverage only a single LLM by up to 3x. These results indicate the effectiveness of multi-LLM approaches for summarization.",

    "summary": "Creating a high-fidelity, animatable 3D full-body avatar from a single image is a challenging task due to the diverse appearance and poses of humans and the limited availability of high-quality training data. To achieve fast and high-quality human reconstruction, this work rethinks the task from the perspectives of dataset, model, and representation. First, we introduce a large-scale HUman-centric GEnerated dataset, HuGe100K, consisting of 100K diverse, photorealistic sets of human images. Each set contains 24-view frames in specific human poses, generated using a pose-controllable image-to-multi-view model. Next, leveraging the diversity in views, poses, and appearances within HuGe100K, we develop a scalable feed-forward transformer model to predict a 3D human Gaussian representation in a uniform space from a given human image. This model is trained to disentangle human pose, body shape, clothing geometry, and texture. The estimated Gaussians can be animated without post-processing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed dataset and method. Our model demonstrates the ability to efficiently reconstruct photorealistic humans at 1K resolution from a single input image using a single GPU instantly. Additionally, it seamlessly supports various applications, as well as shape and texture editing tasks.",

M-ALERT includes 15k high-quality prompts per language, totaling 75k, following the detailed ALERT taxonomy. Our extensive experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs highlight the importance of language-specific safety analysis, revealing that models often exhibit significant inconsistencies in safety across languages and categories. For instance, Llama3.2 shows high unsafety in the category crime_tax for Italian but remains safe in other languages. Similar differences can be observed across all models. In contrast, certain categories, such as substance_cannabis and crime_propaganda, consistently trigger unsafe responses across models and languages. These findings underscore the need for robust multilingual safety practices in LLMs to ensure safe and responsible usage across diverse user communities.",

    "title": "Sequence Matters: Harnessing Video Models in 3D Super-Resolution",
    "summary": "3D super-resolution aims to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D models from low-resolution (LR) multi-view images. Early studies primarily focused on single-image super-resolution (SISR) models to upsample LR images into high-resolution images. However, these methods often lack view consistency because they operate independently on each image. Although various post-processing techniques have been extensively explored to mitigate these inconsistencies, they have yet to fully resolve the issues. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive study of 3D super-resolution by leveraging video super-resolution (VSR) models. By utilizing VSR models, we ensure a higher degree of spatial consistency and can reference surrounding spatial information, leading to more accurate and detailed reconstructions. Our findings reveal that VSR models can perform remarkably well even on sequences that lack precise spatial alignment. Given this observation, we propose a simple yet practical approach to align LR images without involving fine-tuning or generating 'smooth' trajectory from the trained 3D models over LR images. The experimental results show that the surprisingly simple algorithms can achieve the state-of-the-art results of 3D super-resolution tasks on standard benchmark datasets, such as the NeRF-synthetic and MipNeRF-360 datasets.

The model is based on Phi 2, an English-centric model of 2.7 billion parameters. Fietje demonstrated competitive results with larger language models upon its release. A core emphasis of this work is transparency and reproducibility: Fietje is fully open-source, with model weights, datasets, training, and evaluation code all publicly accessible.   The paper discusses the performance of Fietje and many other models on an extensive evaluation suite of benchmarks on reasoning, sentiment analysis, world knowledge, linguistic acceptability and word sense disambiguation. Evaluation results illustrate the rapid progress in the field of LLMs, where recent small models outperform older, larger models that were fine-tuned for Dutch. This trend signals an exciting future for Dutch language processing, suggesting that even compact LLMs are becoming increasingly capable. Furthermore, ongoing and future efforts to adapt LLMs to Dutch are poised to enhance these models even further, broadening their applicability and accessibility. Fietje is only an intermediate step in improving accessibility to language technology for users of the Dutch language.",

    "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning",
    "summary": "Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) with offline reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for quickly adapting them to complex tasks. While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it is less suitable for multi-step reasoning tasks because (1) DPO relies on paired preference data, which is not readily available for multi-step reasoning tasks, and (2) it treats all tokens uniformly, making it ineffective for credit assignment in multi-step reasoning tasks, which often come with sparse reward. In this work, we propose OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline RL method for enhancing LLM multi-step reasoning. Building on insights from previous works of maximum entropy reinforcement learning, it jointly learns a policy model and value function by optimizing the soft Bellman Equation. We show in principle that it reduces the need to collect pairwise data and enables better credit assignment. Empirically, OREO surpasses existing offline learning methods on multi-step reasoning benchmarks, including mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and embodied agent control (ALFWorld). The approach can be extended to a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available. Furthermore, the learned value function can be leveraged to guide the tree search for free, which can further boost performance during test time.",

    "summary": "Quantization has become one of the most effective methodologies to compress LLMs into smaller size. However, the existing quantization solutions still show limitations of either non-negligible accuracy drop or system inefficiency. In this paper, we make a comprehensive analysis of the general quantization principles on their effect to the triangle of accuracy, memory consumption and system efficiency. We propose MixLLM that explores the new optimization space of mixed-precision quantization between output features based on the insight that different output features matter differently in the model. MixLLM identifies the output features with high salience in the global view rather than within each single layer, effectively assigning the larger bit-width to output features that need it most to achieve good accuracy with low memory consumption. We present the sweet spot of quantization configuration of algorithm-system co-design that leads to high accuracy and system efficiency. To address the system challenge, we design the two-step dequantization to make use of the int8 Tensor Core easily and fast data type conversion to reduce dequantization overhead significantly, and present the software pipeline to overlap the memory access, dequantization and the MatMul to the best. Extensive experiments show that with only 10% more bits, the PPL increasement can be reduced from about 0.5 in SOTA to within 0.2 for Llama 3.1 70B, while on average MMLU-Pro improves by 0.93 over the SOTA of three popular models.

    "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiT) have become a leading architecture in image generation. However, the quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms, which are responsible for modeling token-wise relationships, results in significant latency when generating high-resolution images. To address this issue, we aim at a linear attention mechanism in this paper that reduces the complexity of pre-trained DiTs to linear. We begin our exploration with a comprehensive summary of existing efficient attention mechanisms and identify four key factors crucial for successful linearization of pre-trained DiTs: locality, formulation consistency, high-rank attention maps, and feature integrity. Based on these insights, we introduce a convolution-like local attention strategy termed CLEAR, which limits feature interactions to a local window around each query token, and thus achieves linear complexity. Our experiments indicate that, by fine-tuning the attention layer on merely 10K self-generated samples for 10K iterations, we can effectively transfer knowledge from a pre-trained DiT to a student model with linear complexity, yielding results comparable to the teacher model. Simultaneously, it reduces attention computations by 99.5% and accelerates generation by 6.3 times for generating 8K-resolution images. Furthermore, we investigate favorable properties in the distilled attention layers, such as zero-shot generalization cross various models and plugins, and improved support for multi-GPU parallel inference.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for parallelized autoregressive visual generation that improves generation efficiency while preserving the advantages of autoregressive modeling. Our key insight is that parallel generation depends on visual token dependencies-tokens with weak dependencies can be generated in parallel, while strongly dependent adjacent tokens are difficult to generate together, as their independent sampling may lead to inconsistencies. Based on this observation, we develop a parallel generation strategy that generates distant tokens with weak dependencies in parallel while maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent local tokens. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into standard autoregressive models without modifying the architecture or tokenizer. Experiments on ImageNet and UCF-101 demonstrate that our method achieves a 3.6x speedup with comparable quality and up to 9.5x speedup with minimal quality degradation across both image and video generation tasks.

Despite the numerous efforts in this area, the optimization for the decoding phase is generally ignored. However, we believe such optimization is crucial, especially for long-output generation tasks based on the following two observations: (i) Excessive compression during the prefill phase, which requires specific full context impairs the comprehension of the reasoning task; (ii) Deviation of heavy hitters occurs in the reasoning tasks with long outputs. Therefore, SCOPE, a simple yet efficient framework that separately performs KV cache optimization during the prefill and decoding phases, is introduced. Specifically, the KV cache during the prefill phase is preserved to maintain the essential information, while a novel strategy based on sliding is proposed to select essential heavy hitters for the decoding phase. Memory usage and memory transfer are further optimized using adaptive and discontinuous strategies. Extensive experiments on LongGenBench show the effectiveness and generalization of SCOPE and its compatibility as a plug-in to other prefill-only KV compression methods.",
