    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25775v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Contemporary chess engines offer precise yet opaque evaluations, typically expressed as centipawn scores. While effective for decision-making, these outputs obscure the underlying contributions of individual pieces or patterns. In this paper, we explore adapting SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to the domain of chess analysis, aiming to attribute a chess engines evaluation to specific pieces on the board. By treating pieces as features and systematically ablating them, we compute additive, per-piece contributions that explain the engines output in a locally faithful and human-interpretable manner. This method draws inspiration from classical chess pedagogy, where players assess positions by mentally removing pieces, and grounds it in modern explainable AI techniques. Our approach opens new possibilities for visualization, human training, and engine comparison. We release accompanying code and data to foster future research in interpretable chess AI.",

Our implementation is agent-based, which means that individual agents, whether human, algorithmic, or collaborative, are responsible for well-defined tasks, enabling flexibility and simplifying integration. Moreover, our framework supports modular integration and maintains low resource requirements.

Yet it remains unclear whether constrained prompts actually improve player experience. We investigate this question through The Interview, a voice-based detective game powered by GPT-4o. A within-subjects usability study ($N=10$) compared high-constraint (HCP) and low-constraint (LCP) prompts, revealing no reliable experiential differences beyond sensitivity to technical breakdowns. Guided by these findings, we redesigned the HCP into a hybrid JSON+RAG scaffold and conducted a synthetic evaluation with an LLM judge, positioned as an early-stage complement to usability testing. Results uncovered a novel pattern: scaffolding effects were role-dependent: the Interviewer (quest-giver NPC) gained stability, while suspect NPCs lost improvisational believability. These findings overturn the assumption that tighter constraints inherently enhance play. Extending fuzzy-symbolic scaffolding, we introduce \\textit{Symbolically Scaffolded Play}, a framework in which symbolic structures are expressed as fuzzy, numerical boundaries that stabilize coherence where needed while preserving improvisation where surprise sustains engagement.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25860v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as raters for evaluation tasks. However, their reliability is often limited for subjective tasks, when human judgments involve subtle reasoning beyond annotation labels. Thinking traces, the reasoning behind a judgment, are highly informative but challenging to collect and curate. We present a human-LLM collaborative framework to infer thinking traces from label-only annotations. The proposed framework uses a simple and effective rejection sampling method to reconstruct these traces at scale. These inferred thinking traces are applied to two complementary tasks: (1) fine-tuning open LLM raters; and (2) synthesizing clearer annotation guidelines for proprietary LLM raters. Across multiple datasets, our methods lead to significantly improved LLM-human agreement. Additionally, the refined annotation guidelines increase agreement among different LLM models. These results suggest that LLMs can serve as practical proxies for otherwise unrevealed human thinking traces, enabling label-only corpora to be extended into thinking-trace-augmented resources that enhance the reliability of LLM raters.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25883v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Existing frameworks converge on the centrality of compression to intelligence but leave underspecified why this process enforces the discovery of causal structure rather than superficial statistical patterns. We introduce a two-level framework to address this gap. The Information-Theoretic Imperative (ITI) establishes that any system persisting in uncertain environments must minimize epistemic entropy through predictive compression: this is the evolutionary \"why\" linking survival pressure to information-processing demands. The Compression Efficiency Principle (CEP) specifies how efficient compression mechanically selects for generative, causal models through exception-accumulation dynamics, making reality alignment a consequence rather than a contingent achievement. Together, ITI and CEP define a causal chain: from survival pressure to prediction necessity, compression requirement, efficiency optimization, generative structure discovery, and ultimately reality alignment. Each link follows from physical, information-theoretic, or evolutionary constraints, implying that intelligence is the mechanically necessary outcome of persistence in structured environments. This framework yields empirically testable predictions: compression efficiency, measured as approach to the rate-distortion frontier, correlates with out-of-distribution generalization; exception-accumulation rates differentiate causal from correlational models; hierarchical systems exhibit increasing efficiency across abstraction layers; and biological systems demonstrate metabolic costs that track representational complexity. ITI and CEP thereby provide a unified account of convergence across biological, artificial, and multi-scale systems, addressing the epistemic and functional dimensions of intelligence without invoking assumptions about consciousness or subjective experience.",

Overcoming this challenge advances key applications, such as creating reliable reward models for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and building effective routing systems that select the best-suited model for a given user query. In this work, we propose a framework for modeling diverse, persona-based preferences by learning to aggregate outputs from multiple rubric-conditioned judges. We investigate the performance of this approach against naive baselines and assess its robustness through case studies on both human and LLM-judges biases.

General-purpose industry models overall outperformed science-specialized models across each trustworthiness dimension, with GPT-o4-mini demonstrating superior performance in truthfulness assessments and adversarial robustness. Science-specialized models showed significant deficiencies in logical and ethical reasoning capabilities, along with concerning vulnerabilities in safety evaluations, particularly in high-risk domains such as biosecurity and chemical weapons.

To address this challenge, we propose leveraging autonomous, goal-driven AI agents for FinOps automation.

We built a system simulating a realistic end-to-end industry process starting with retrieving data from various sources to consolidating and analyzing the data to generate recommendations for optimization.

For example, people's attention to objects in their environment will be biased in a way that systematically affects how they perform everyday tasks such as driving to work. Here, building on recent work in computational cognitive science, we formally articulate the attention-aware inverse planning problem, in which the goal is to estimate a person's attentional biases from their actions. We demonstrate how attention-aware inverse planning systematically differs from standard inverse reinforcement learning and how cognitive biases can be inferred from behavior. Finally, we present an approach to attention-aware inverse planning that combines deep reinforcement learning with computational cognitive modeling. We use this approach to infer the attentional strategies of RL agents in real-life driving scenarios selected from the Waymo Open Dataset, demonstrating the scalability of estimating cognitive biases with attention-aware inverse planning.",

We present an agentic pipeline that extends a naive text-to-SQL baseline (llama-3-sqlcoder-8b) with orchestration by a Mistral-based ReAct agent. The agent can plan, decompose, and adapt queries through schema inspection, SQL generation, execution, and visualization tools. We evaluate on 35 natural-language queries over the NYC and Tokyo check-in dataset, covering spatial, temporal, and multi-dataset reasoning. The agent achieves substantially higher accuracy than the naive baseline 91.4% vs. 28.6% and enhances usability through maps, plots, and structured natural-language summaries. Crucially, our design enables more natural human-database interaction, supporting users who lack SQL expertise, detailed schema knowledge, or prompting skill.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite significant advancements in recent decades, autonomous vehicles (AVs) continue to face challenges in navigating certain traffic scenarios where human drivers excel. In such situations, AVs often become immobilized, disrupting overall traffic flow. Current recovery solutions, such as remote intervention (which is costly and inefficient) and manual takeover (which excludes non-drivers and limits AV accessibility), are inadequate. This paper introduces StuckSolver, a novel Large Language Model (LLM) driven recovery framework that enables AVs to resolve immobilization scenarios through self-reasoning and/or passenger-guided decision-making. StuckSolver is designed as a plug-in add-on module that operates on top of the AV's existing perception-planning-control stack, requiring no modification to its internal architecture. Instead, it interfaces with standard sensor data streams to detect immobilization states, interpret environmental context, and generate high-level recovery commands that can be executed by the AV's native planner. We evaluate StuckSolver on the Bench2Drive benchmark and in custom-designed uncertainty scenarios. Results show that StuckSolver achieves near-state-of-the-art performance through autonomous self-reasoning alone and exhibits further improvements when passenger guidance is incorporated.",

In general, an agent is accountable to a forum if the forum can request information from the agent about its actions, if the forum and the agent can discuss this information, and if the forum can sanction the agent. Unfortunately, in too many cases today's AI is not accountable -- we cannot question it, enter into a discussion with it, let alone sanction it.

We hypothesize this gap stems from missing core GUI knowledge, which existing training schemes (such as supervised fine tuning and reinforcement learning) alone cannot fully address. By analyzing common failure patterns in GUI task execution, we distill GUI knowledge into three dimensions: (1) interface perception, knowledge about recognizing widgets and system states; (2) interaction prediction, knowledge about reasoning action state transitions; and (3) instruction understanding, knowledge about planning, verifying, and assessing task completion progress. We further introduce GUI Knowledge Bench, a benchmark with multiple choice and yes/no questions across six platforms (Web, Android, MacOS, Windows, Linux, IOS) and 292 applications. Our evaluation shows that current VLMs identify widget functions but struggle with perceiving system states, predicting actions, and verifying task completion. Experiments on real world GUI tasks further validate the close link between GUI knowledge and task success. By providing a structured framework for assessing GUI knowledge, our work supports the selection of VLMs with greater potential prior to downstream training and provides insights for building more capable GUI agents.",

    "title": "Questionnaire meets LLM: A Benchmark and Empirical Study of Structural Skills for Understanding Questions and Responses",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26238v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Millions of people take surveys every day, from market polls and academic studies to medical questionnaires and customer feedback forms. These datasets capture valuable insights, but their scale and structure present a unique challenge for large language models (LLMs), which otherwise excel at few-shot reasoning over open-ended text. Yet, their ability to process questionnaire data or lists of questions crossed with hundreds of respondent rows remains underexplored. Current retrieval and survey analysis tools (e.g., Qualtrics, SPSS, REDCap) are typically designed for humans in the workflow, limiting such data integration with LLM and AI-empowered automation. This gap leaves scientists, surveyors, and everyday users without evidence-based guidance on how to best represent questionnaires for LLM consumption. We address this by introducing QASU (Questionnaire Analysis and Structural Understanding), a benchmark that probes six structural skills, including answer lookup, respondent count, and multi-hop inference, across six serialization formats and multiple prompt strategies. Experiments on contemporary LLMs show that choosing an effective format and prompt combination can improve accuracy by up to 8.8% points compared to suboptimal formats. For specific tasks, carefully adding a lightweight structural hint through self-augmented prompting can yield further improvements of 3-4% points on average. By systematically isolating format and prompting effects, our open source benchmark offers a simple yet versatile foundation for advancing both research and real-world practice in LLM-based questionnaire analysis.",

    "title": "Retrieval Augmented Generation-Enhanced Distributed LLM Agents for Generalizable Traffic Signal Control with Emergency Vehicles",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26242v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: With increasing urban traffic complexity, Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is essential for optimizing traffic flow and improving road safety. Large Language Models (LLMs) emerge as promising approaches for TSC. However, they are prone to hallucinations in emergencies, leading to unreliable decisions that may cause substantial delays for emergency vehicles. Moreover, diverse intersection types present substantial challenges for traffic state encoding and cross-intersection training, limiting generalization across heterogeneous intersections. Therefore, this paper proposes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced distributed LLM agents with Emergency response for Generalizable TSC (REG-TSC). Firstly, this paper presents an emergency-aware reasoning framework, which dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on the emergency scenario and is equipped with a novel Reviewer-based Emergency RAG (RERAG) to distill specific knowledge and guidance from historical cases, enhancing the reliability and rationality of agents' emergency decisions. Secondly, this paper designs a type-agnostic traffic representation and proposes a Reward-guided Reinforced Refinement (R3) for heterogeneous intersections. R3 adaptively samples training experience from diverse intersections with environment feedback-based priority and fine-tunes LLM agents with a designed reward-weighted likelihood loss, guiding REG-TSC toward high-reward policies across heterogeneous intersections. On three real-world road networks with 17 to 177 heterogeneous intersections, extensive experiments show that REG-TSC reduces travel time by 42.00%, queue length by 62.31%, and emergency vehicle waiting time by 83.16%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.",

Yet, when applied to train multi-turn, interactive LLM agents, these methods often suffer from structural blindness-the inability to exploit the underlying connectivity of the environment. This manifests in three critical challenges: (1) inefficient, unguided exploration, (2) imprecise credit assignment due to overlooking pivotal states, and (3) myopic planning caused by static reward discounting. We address these issues with Graph-Enhanced Policy Optimization (GEPO), which dynamically constructs a state-transition graph from agent experience and employs graph-theoretic centrality to provide three synergistic learning signals: (1)structured intrinsic rewards that guide exploration toward high-impact states, (2) a graph-enhanced advantage function for topology-aware credit assignment, and (3) a dynamic discount factor adapted to each state's strategic value. On the ALFWorld, WebShop, and a proprietary Workbench benchmarks, GEPO demonstrates strong performance, achieving absolute success rate gains of +4.1%, +5.3%, and +10.9% over competitive baselines.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26309v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Compliance at web scale poses practical challenges: each request may require a regulatory assessment. Regulatory texts (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation, GDPR) are cross-referential and normative, while runtime contexts are expressed in unstructured natural language. This setting motivates us to align semantic information in unstructured text with the structured, normative elements of regulations. To this end, we introduce GraphCompliance, a framework that represents regulatory texts as a Policy Graph and runtime contexts as a Context Graph, and aligns them. In this formulation, the policy graph encodes normative structure and cross-references, whereas the context graph formalizes events as subject-action-object (SAO) and entity-relation triples. This alignment anchors the reasoning of a judge large language model (LLM) in structured information and helps reduce the burden of regulatory interpretation and event parsing, enabling a focus on the core reasoning step. In experiments on 300 GDPR-derived real-world scenarios spanning five evaluation tasks, GraphCompliance yields 4.1-7.2 percentage points (pp) higher micro-F1 than LLM-only and RAG baselines, with fewer under- and over-predictions, resulting in higher recall and lower false positive rates. Ablation studies indicate contributions from each graph component, suggesting that structured representations and a judge LLM are complementary for normative reasoning.",

Though state-action pair abstractions are mostly easy to find in algorithms such as On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT), nearly no state abstractions are found in either noisy or large action space settings due to constraining conditions. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence for this claim, and we slightly alleviate this state abstraction problem by proposing a weaker state abstraction condition that trades a minor loss in accuracy for finding many more abstractions. We name this technique Ideal Pruning Abstractions in UCT (IPA-UCT), which outperforms OGA-UCT (and any of its derivatives) across a large range of test domains and iteration budgets as experimentally validated. IPA-UCT uses a different abstraction framework from Abstraction of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) which is the one used by OGA-UCT, which we name IPA.

To make implicit evidence practical, we instantiate it with an ultra-light interpolation-based plug-in that estimates difficulties of unevaluated tasks without extra rollouts, adding negligible overhead. Empirically, across diverse domains and LLM scales, BOTS consistently improves data efficiency and performance over baselines and ablations, providing a practical and extensible solution for dynamic task selection in RFT.",

Current methods for this task operate under a model-centric paradigm, selecting benchmarking items based on the collective performance of existing models. Such approaches are limited by large upfront costs, an inability to immediately handle new benchmarks (`cold-start'), and the fragile assumption that future models will share the failure patterns of their predecessors. In this work, we challenge this paradigm and propose a item-centric approach to benchmark subset selection, arguing that selection should be based on the intrinsic properties of the task items themselves, rather than on model-specific failure patterns. We instantiate this item-centric efficient benchmarking approach via a novel method, Scales++, where data selection is based on the cognitive demands of the benchmark samples. Empirically, we show Scales++ reduces the upfront selection cost by over 18x while achieving competitive predictive fidelity. On the Open LLM Leaderboard, using just a 0.5\\% data subset, we predict full benchmark scores with a 2.9% mean absolute error. We demonstrate that this item-centric approach enables more efficient model evaluation without significant fidelity degradation, while also providing better cold-start performance and more interpretable benchmarking.",

This paper proposes a pragmatic framework for navigating this diversification by treating personhood not as a metaphysical property to be discovered, but as a flexible bundle of obligations (rights and responsibilities) that societies confer upon entities for a variety of reasons, especially to solve concrete governance problems. We argue that this traditional bundle can be unbundled, creating bespoke solutions for different contexts. This will allow for the creation of practical tools -- such as facilitating AI contracting by creating a target \"individual\" that can be sanctioned -- without needing to resolve intractable debates about an AI's consciousness or rationality. We explore how individuals fit in to social roles and discuss the use of decentralized digital identity technology, examining both \"personhood as a problem\", where design choices can create \"dark patterns\" that exploit human social heuristics, and \"personhood as a solution\", where conferring a bundle of obligations is necessary to ensure accountability or prevent conflict. By rejecting foundationalist quests for a single, essential definition of personhood, this paper offers a more pragmatic and flexible way to think about integrating AI agents into our society.",

Yet we find the opposite: the same reasoning can be used to bypass safeguards. We introduce Chain-of-Thought Hijacking, a jailbreak attack on reasoning models. The attack pads harmful requests with long sequences of harmless puzzle reasoning. Across HarmBench, CoT Hijacking reaches a 99%, 94%, 100%, and 94% attack success rate (ASR) on Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT o4 mini, Grok 3 mini, and Claude 4 Sonnet, respectively - far exceeding prior jailbreak methods for LRMs. To understand the effectiveness of our attack, we turn to a mechanistic analysis, which shows that mid layers encode the strength of safety checking, while late layers encode the verification outcome. Long benign CoT dilutes both signals by shifting attention away from harmful tokens. Targeted ablations of attention heads identified by this analysis causally decrease refusal, confirming their role in a safety subnetwork. These results show that the most interpretable form of reasoning - explicit CoT - can itself become a jailbreak vector when combined with final-answer cues.

With the advent of computers and artificial intelligence, these contexts are no longer limited to purely human--human interactions: human--machine interactions are included as well. Then a central question emerges: How can machines better understand our situations and purposes? To address this challenge, researchers have recently introduced the concept of context engineering. Although it is often regarded as a recent innovation of the agent era, we argue that related practices can be traced back more than twenty years. Since the early 1990s, the field has evolved through distinct historical phases, each shaped by the intelligence level of machines: from early human--computer interaction frameworks built around primitive computers, to today's human--agent interaction paradigms driven by intelligent agents, and potentially to human--level or superhuman intelligence in the future. In this paper, we situate context engineering, provide a systematic definition, outline its historical and conceptual landscape, and examine key design considerations for practice. By addressing these questions, we aim to offer a conceptual foundation for context engineering and sketch its promising future.

This paper presents an agentic AI HEMS where LLMs autonomously coordinate multi-appliance scheduling from natural language requests to device control, achieving optimal scheduling without example demonstrations. A hierarchical architecture combining one orchestrator with three specialist agents uses the ReAct pattern for iterative reasoning, enabling dynamic coordination without hardcoded workflows while integrating Google Calendar for context-aware deadline extraction. Evaluation across three open-source models using real Austrian day-ahead electricity prices reveals substantial capability differences. Llama-3.3-70B successfully coordinates all appliances across all scenarios to match cost-optimal benchmarks computed via mixed-integer linear programming, while other models achieve perfect single-appliance performance but struggle to coordinate all appliances simultaneously.

In this paper, we systematically evaluate LLMs' reasoning capabilities in the normative domain from both logical and modal perspectives. Specifically, to assess how well LLMs reason with normative modals, we make a comparison between their reasoning with normative modals and their reasoning with epistemic modals, which share a common formal structure. To this end, we introduce a new dataset covering a wide range of formal patterns of reasoning in both normative and epistemic domains, while also incorporating non-formal cognitive factors that influence human reasoning. Our results indicate that, although LLMs generally adhere to valid reasoning patterns, they exhibit notable inconsistencies in specific types of normative reasoning and display cognitive biases similar to those observed in psychological studies of human reasoning. These findings highlight challenges in achieving logical consistency in LLMs' normative reasoning and provide insights for enhancing their reliability.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26658v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We envision a new era of AI, termed agentic organization, where agents solve complex problems by working collaboratively and concurrently, enabling outcomes beyond individual intelligence. To realize this vision, we introduce asynchronous thinking (AsyncThink) as a new paradigm of reasoning with large language models, which organizes the internal thinking process into concurrently executable structures. Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that AsyncThink achieves 28% lower inference latency compared to parallel thinking while improving accuracy on mathematical reasoning. Moreover, AsyncThink generalizes its learned asynchronous thinking capabilities, effectively tackling unseen tasks without additional training.",

We introduce and assess a delegated authorization model enabling authorization servers to semantically inspect access requests to protected resources, and issue access tokens constrained to the minimal set of scopes necessary for the agents' assigned tasks. Given the unavailability of datasets centered on delegated authorization flows, particularly including both semantically appropriate and inappropriate scope requests for a given task, we introduce ASTRA, a dataset and data generation pipeline for benchmarking semantic matching between tasks and scopes. Our experiments show both the potential and current limitations of model-based matching, particularly as the number of scopes needed for task completion increases. Our results highlight the need for further research into semantic matching techniques enabling intent-aware authorization for multi-agent and tool-augmented applications, including fine-grained control, such as Task-Based Access Control (TBAC).",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26721v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifically, we hypothesize that visual key vectors (Visual Keys) are out-of-distribution (OOD) relative to the text key space learned during language-only pretraining. Consequently, these visual keys receive systematically lower similarity scores during attention computation, leading to their under-utilization in the context representation. To validate this hypothesis, we extract key vectors from LLaVA and Qwen2.5-VL and analyze their distributional structures using qualitative (t-SNE) and quantitative (Jensen-Shannon divergence) methods. The results provide direct evidence that visual and textual keys occupy markedly distinct subspaces within the attention space. The inter-modal divergence is statistically significant, exceeding intra-modal variation by several orders of magnitude. These findings reveal that text bias arises from an intrinsic misalignment within the attention key space rather than solely from external data factors.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26752v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the human's choice determines the outcome, potentially leading to a corrective action or a system shutdown. We model this interaction as a two-player Markov Game. Our analysis focuses on cases where this game qualifies as a Markov Potential Game (MPG), a class of games where we can provide an alignment guarantee: under a structural assumption on the human's value function, any decision by the agent to act more autonomously that benefits itself cannot harm the human's value. We also analyze extensions to this MPG framework. Theoretically, this perspective provides conditions for a specific form of intrinsic alignment. If the reward structures of the human-agent game meet these conditions, we have a formal guarantee that the agent improving its own outcome will not harm the human's. Practically, this model motivates a transparent control layer with predictable incentives where the agent learns to defer when risky and act when safe, while its pretrained policy and the environment's reward structure remain untouched. Our gridworld simulation shows that through independent learning, the agent and human discover their optimal oversight roles. The agent learns to ask when uncertain and the human learns when to oversee, leading to an emergent collaboration that avoids safety violations introduced post-training. This demonstrates a practical method for making misaligned models safer after deployment.",

Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub filter heads, encode a compact representation of the filtering predicate in their query states at certain tokens. We demonstrate that this predicate representation is general and portable: it can be extracted and reapplied to execute the same filtering operation on different collections, presented in different formats, languages, or even in tasks. However, we also identify situations where transformer LMs can exploit a different strategy for filtering: eagerly evaluating if an item satisfies the predicate and storing this intermediate result as a flag directly in the item representations. Our results reveal that transformer LMs can develop human-interpretable implementations of abstract computational operations that generalize in ways that are surprisingly similar to strategies used in traditional functional programming patterns.",

Such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However, previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop Magentic-Marketplace-- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare-- but only under ideal search conditions. Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.",

By collecting and categorizing a vast array of open-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN development. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs, establishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter efficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the critical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices, including B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions, Gaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in terms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize recent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving accuracy, efficiency, and regularization.

To test this resolution hypothesis, we introduce HiMAE (Hierarchical Masked Autoencoder), a self supervised framework that combines masked autoencoding with a hierarchical convolutional encoder decoder. HiMAE produces multi resolution embeddings that enable systematic evaluation of which temporal scales carry predictive signal, transforming resolution from a hyperparameter into a probe for interpretability. Across classification, regression, and generative benchmarks, HiMAE consistently outperforms state of the art foundation models that collapse scale, while being orders of magnitude smaller. HiMAE is an efficient representation learner compact enough to run entirely on watch, achieving sub millisecond inference on smartwatch class CPUs for true edge inference. Together, these contributions position HiMAE as both an efficient self supervised learning method and a discovery tool for scale sensitive structure in wearable health.",

In-memory computing with nanoscale resistive memories may play a crucial role in enabling the execution of AI workloads on these edge devices. In this study, we introduce voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity (VDSP) as an efficient approach for unsupervised and local learning in memristive synapses based on Hebbian principles. This method enables online learning without requiring complex pulse-shaping circuits typically necessary for spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We show how VDSP can be advantageously adapted to three types of memristive devices (TiO$_2$, HfO$_2$-based metal-oxide filamentary synapses, and HfZrO$_4$-based ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJ)) with disctinctive switching characteristics. System-level simulations of spiking neural networks incorporating these devices were conducted to validate unsupervised learning on MNIST-based pattern recognition tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

We investigate these learning dynamics through the lens of grokking by pretraining transformers on symbolic reasoning tasks with tunable algorithmic complexity and controllable data composition to study their generalization. Models were trained under two settings: (i) producing only final answers, and (ii) emitting explicit CoT traces before answering. Our results show that while CoT generally improves task performance, its benefits depend on task complexity. To quantify these effects, we model the accuracy of the logarithmic training steps with a three-parameter logistic curve, revealing how the learning speed and shape vary with task complexity, data distribution, and the presence of CoT supervision. We also uncover a transient trace unfaithfulness phase: early in training, models often produce correct answers while skipping or contradicting CoT steps, before later aligning their reasoning traces with answers. Empirically, we (1) demonstrate that CoT accelerates generalization but does not overcome tasks with higher algorithmic complexity, such as finding list intersections; (2) introduce a kinetic modeling framework for understanding transformer learning; (3) characterize trace faithfulness as a dynamic property that emerges over training; and (4) show CoT alters internal transformer computation mechanistically.",

This service can reduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and environmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic decision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To address this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL) approach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing systems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In this study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018) from ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within the learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we propose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing n-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive spatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the non-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the non-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4% versus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for passengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size by over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of performance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators. Incorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time by up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1% compared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of increased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.",

While recent knowledge editing techniques hint at promising directions, they often focus on editing a single modality (vision or language) in isolation. This prevalent practice neglects the inherent multimodality of LVLMs and the continuous nature of knowledge updates, potentially leading to suboptimal editing outcomes when considering the interplay between modalities and the need for ongoing knowledge refinement. To address these limitations, we propose MemEIC, a novel method for Continual and Compositional Knowledge Editing (CCKE) in LVLMs. MemEIC enables compositional editing of both visual and textual knowledge sequentially. Our approach employs a hybrid external-internal editor featuring a dual external memory for cross-modal evidence retrieval and dual LoRA adapters that facilitate disentangled parameter updates for each modality. A key component is a brain-inspired knowledge connector, activated selectively for compositional reasoning, that integrates information across different modalities. Experiments demonstrate that MemEIC significantly improves performance on complex multimodal questions and effectively preserves prior edits, setting a new benchmark for CCKE in LVLMs.",

Most representative paradigms begin with a cold start, typically employing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), to initialize the policy before RL. However, SFT-based cold start adopts the reasoning paradigm intertwined with task solution and output format, which may induce instruction-style overfitting, weakens out-of-distribution generalization, and ultimately affects downstream RL. We revisit the cold start along two views, its training method and data construction, and introduce the Generalization Factor (GF) coefficient to quantify the generalization capability under different methods. Our empirical study finds that preference-based training methods (e.g. DPO) generalizes better than SFT-based methods in cold start. Motivated by this, we propose SPECS-a Self-distilled, Preference-based Cold Start framework that decouples multimodal learning: (1) generates introspective preference data pairs via self-distillation, avoiding reliance on larger teachers or manual annotation; (2) performs preference-based training to learn, focusing on shallow, transferable surface-form criteria (format, structure, style) rather than memorizing content; and (3) hands off to RL with verifiable rewards for deep reasoning results.

When violations occur, PRISM performs audit-guided repair and records generation traces for compliance review.

Nonetheless, despite the potential of such tools for linguistic research, comprehensive evaluation of their performance and impact on the creation of annotated datasets, especially under a perspectivized approach to NLP, is still missing. This paper contributes to reduction of this gap by reporting on an extensive evaluation of the (semi-)automatization of FrameNet-like semantic annotation by the use of an LLM-based semantic role labeler. The methodology employed compares annotation time, coverage and diversity in three experimental settings: manual, automatic and semi-automatic annotation.

More generally, understanding how emergent behavior, be it a cartel or market dominance from more advanced bots, affects the market overall is an important research question.\n  We propose a hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to study algorithmic collusion in market making. The framework includes a self-interested market maker (Agent~A), which is trained in an uncertain environment shaped by an adversary, and three bottom-layer competitors: the self-interested Agent~B1 (whose objective is to maximize its own PnL), the competitive Agent~B2 (whose objective is to minimize the PnL of its opponent), and the hybrid Agent~B$^\\star$, which can modulate between the behavior of the other two. To analyze how these agents shape the behavior of each other and affect market outcomes, we propose interaction-level metrics that quantify behavioral asymmetry and system-level dynamics, while providing signals potentially indicative of emergent interaction patterns.\n  Experimental results show that Agent~B2 secures dominant performance in a zero-sum setting against B1, aggressively capturing order flow while tightening average spreads, thus improving market execution efficiency. In contrast, Agent~B$^\\star$ exhibits a self-interested inclination when co-existing with other profit-seeking agents, securing dominant market share through adaptive quoting, yet exerting a milder adverse impact on the rewards of Agents~A and B1 compared to B2. These findings suggest that adaptive incentive control supports more sustainable strategic co-existence in heterogeneous agent environments and offers a structured lens for evaluating behavioral design in algorithmic trading systems.",

In this work, we investigate these assumptions by training 1.1B and 3B parameter LLMs on diverse multilingual corpora, varying the number of languages from 25 to 400. Our study challenges common beliefs surrounding multilingual training. First, we find that combining English and multilingual data does not necessarily degrade the in-language performance of either group, provided that languages have a sufficient number of tokens included in the pretraining corpus. Second, we observe that using English as a pivot language (i.e., a high-resource language that serves as a catalyst for multilingual generalization) yields benefits across language families, and contrary to expectations, selecting a pivot language from within a specific family does not consistently improve performance for languages within that family. Lastly, we do not observe a significant \"curse of multilinguality\" as the number of training languages increases in models at this scale. Our findings suggest that multilingual data, when balanced appropriately, can enhance language model capabilities without compromising performance, even in low-resource settings",

Geospatial Foundation Models (GeoFMs) offer a promising avenue by synthesizing diverse spatial, temporal, and behavioral data into mathematical embeddings that can be efficiently used for downstream prediction tasks. This study evaluated the predictive performance of three GeoFM embedding sources - Google Population Dynamics Foundation Model (PDFM), Google AlphaEarth (derived from satellite imagery), and mobile phone call detail records (CDR) - for modeling 15 routine health programmatic outputs in Malawi, and compared their utility to traditional geospatial interpolation methods. We used XGBoost models on data from 552 health catchment areas (January 2021-May 2023), assessing performance with R2, and using an 80/20 training and test data split with 5-fold cross-validation used in training. While predictive performance was mixed, the embedding-based approaches improved upon baseline geostatistical methods in 13 of 15 (87%) indicators tested. A Multi-GeoFM model integrating all three embedding sources produced the most robust predictions, achieving average 5-fold cross validated R2 values for indicators like population density (0.63), new HIV cases (0.57), and child vaccinations (0.47) and test set R2 of 0.64, 0.68, and 0.55, respectively. Prediction was poor for prediction targets with low primary data availability, such as TB and malnutrition cases. These results demonstrate that GeoFM embeddings imbue a modest predictive improvement for select health and demographic outcomes in an LMIC context. We conclude that the integration of multiple GeoFM sources is an efficient and valuable tool for supplementing and strengthening constrained routine health information systems.",

Despite recent progress enabled by diffusion models, current methods often lack faithfulness to the actual seen images. We present \"Brain-IT\", a brain-inspired approach that addresses this challenge through a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT), allowing effective interactions between clusters of functionally-similar brain-voxels. These functional-clusters are shared by all subjects, serving as building blocks for integrating information both within and across brains. All model components are shared by all clusters & subjects, allowing efficient training with a limited amount of data. To guide the image reconstruction, BIT predicts two complementary localized patch-level image features: (i)high-level semantic features which steer the diffusion model toward the correct semantic content of the image; and (ii)low-level structural features which help to initialize the diffusion process with the correct coarse layout of the image. BIT's design enables direct flow of information from brain-voxel clusters to localized image features. Through these principles, our method achieves image reconstructions from fMRI that faithfully reconstruct the seen images, and surpass current SotA approaches both visually and by standard objective metrics. Moreover, with only 1-hour of fMRI data from a new subject, we achieve results comparable to current methods trained on full 40-hour recordings.",

For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.",

However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.",

While intuitive, we hypothesize, this pursuit of representational convergence can inadvertently cause \"cultural erasure\", the functional loss of providing culturally-situated responses that should diverge based on the query language. In this work, we systematically analyze this trade-off by introducing a holistic evaluation framework, the transfer-localization plane, which quantifies both desirable knowledge transfer and undesirable cultural erasure. Using this framework, we re-evaluate recent CLA approaches and find that they consistently improve factual transfer at the direct cost of cultural localization across all six languages studied. Our investigation into the internal representations of these models reveals a key insight: universal factual transfer and culturally-specific knowledge are optimally steerable at different model layers. Based on this finding, we propose Surgical Steering, a novel inference-time method that disentangles these two objectives. By applying targeted activation steering to distinct layers, our approach achieves a better balance between the two competing dimensions, effectively overcoming the limitations of current alignment techniques.",

Their prevalence, features, and clinical consequences remain undefined. Objective To develop, validate, and deploy a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline to identify ITFs in radiology reports and assess their prevalence, features, and clinical outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants Retrospective cohort of adults without prior thyroid disease undergoing thyroid-capturing imaging at Mayo Clinic sites from July 1, 2017, to September 30, 2023. A transformer-based NLP pipeline identified ITFs and extracted nodule characteristics from image reports from multiple modalities and body regions. Main Outcomes and Measures Prevalence of ITFs, downstream thyroid ultrasound, biopsy, thyroidectomy, and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Logistic regression identified demographic and imaging-related factors. Results Among 115,683 patients (mean age, 56.8 [SD 17.2] years; 52.9% women), 9,077 (7.8%) had an ITF, of which 92.9% were nodules. ITFs were more likely in women, older adults, those with higher BMI, and when imaging was ordered by oncology or internal medicine. Compared with chest CT, ITFs were more likely via neck CT, PET, and nuclear medicine scans. Nodule characteristics were poorly documented, with size reported in 44% and other features in fewer than 15% (e.g. calcifications). Compared with patients without ITFs, those with ITFs had higher odds of thyroid nodule diagnosis, biopsy, thyroidectomy and thyroid cancer diagnosis. Most cancers were papillary, and larger when detected after ITFs vs no ITF. Conclusions ITFs were common and strongly associated with cascades leading to the detection of small, low-risk cancers. These findings underscore the role of ITFs in thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and the need for standardized reporting and more selective follow-up.",

We present SIRAJ: a generic red-teaming framework for arbitrary black-box LLM agents. We employ a dynamic two-step process that starts with an agent definition and generates diverse seed test cases that cover various risk outcomes, tool-use trajectories, and risk sources. Then, it iteratively constructs and refines model-based adversarial attacks based on the execution trajectories of former attempts. To optimize the red-teaming cost, we present a model distillation approach that leverages structured forms of a teacher model's reasoning to train smaller models that are equally effective. Across diverse evaluation agent settings, our seed test case generation approach yields 2 -- 2.5x boost to the coverage of risk outcomes and tool-calling trajectories. Our distilled 8B red-teamer model improves attack success rate by 100%, surpassing the 671B Deepseek-R1 model.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26038v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective method for model compression and transferring knowledge between models. However, its effect on model's robustness against spurious correlations that degrade performance on out-of-distribution data remains underexplored. This study investigates the effect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing'' capabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language inference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments, we illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a model is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit from injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a model may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur across different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention pattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above findings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of debiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing iterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights obtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale. Our findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better debiasing methods.",

The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26068v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper proposes a novel paradigm for machine learning that moves beyond traditional parameter optimization. Unlike conventional approaches that search for optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to treat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we optimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology, thereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To achieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function carefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of the manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data, while the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular geometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the computational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we introduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the continuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric tensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using automatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound analogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general relativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of \"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric optimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with fixed geometry. This work lays a solid foundation for constructing fully dynamic \"meta-learners\" capable of autonomously evolving their geometry and topology, and it points to broad application prospects in areas such as scientific model discovery and robust representation learning.",

In this paper, we present Nirvana, an SGM with specialized memory mechanism, linear time complexity, and test-time task information extraction. Besides, we propose the Task-Aware Memory Trigger ($\\textit{Trigger}$) that flexibly adjusts memory mechanism based on the current task's requirements. In Trigger, each incoming sample is treated as a self-supervised fine-tuning task, enabling Nirvana to adapt its task-related parameters on the fly to domain shifts. We also design the Specialized Memory Updater ($\\textit{Updater}$) that dynamically memorizes the context guided by Trigger. We conduct experiments on both general language tasks and specialized medical tasks. On a variety of natural language modeling benchmarks, Nirvana achieves competitive or superior results compared to the existing LLM structures. To prove the effectiveness of Trigger on specialized tasks, we test Nirvana's performance on a challenging medical task, i.e., Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). We post-train frozen Nirvana backbone with lightweight codecs on paired electromagnetic signals and MRI images.

While the Shortest Path First (SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it performs poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion by routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle routing through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for coordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive Navigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent provides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood state modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in large networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation (HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections (hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles micro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive Q-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions via attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local congestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on synthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces average travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing success. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up to 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic. These findings highlight the potential of network-constrained MARL for scalable, coordinated, and congestion-aware routing in intelligent transportation systems.",

This amounts to averaging performance geospatially across the Earth in weather and climate settings, failing to account for the non-uniform distribution of human development and geography. We introduce Stratified Assessments of Forecasts over Earth (SAFE), a package for elucidating the stratified performance of a set of predictions made over Earth. SAFE integrates various data domains to stratify by different attributes associated with geospatial gridpoints: territory (usually country), global subregion, income, and landcover (land or water). This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual stratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual country). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of state-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all exhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to seed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different lead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged metrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and which models are most fair?

Contrary to expectations, our investigations reveal that the alignment between textual and Image modalities in existing diffusion models is inadequate. This misalignment presents significant risks, especially in the generation of inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. To this end, we propose a novel attack called Prompt-Restricted Multi-modal Attack (PReMA) to manipulate the generated content by modifying the input image in conjunction with any specified prompt, without altering the prompt itself. PReMA is the first attack that manipulates model outputs by solely creating adversarial images, distinguishing itself from prior methods that primarily generate adversarial prompts to produce NSFW content. Consequently, PReMA poses a novel threat to the integrity of multi-modal diffusion models, particularly in image-editing applications that operate with fixed prompts. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on image inpainting and style transfer tasks across various models confirm the potent efficacy of PReMA.",

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily feature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of these systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall short in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating performance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the Waymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021 driving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging long-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring frequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the high-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8 surrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail situations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback Score (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between predicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted trajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have released rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while the held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.

We propose a generative framework that learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring explicit utility specification.\n  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy.

The rate of readmission is being used as a benchmark to determine the quality of healthcare provided by the hospitals. In thisproject, we have used machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Support Vector Machines to analyze the health claims data and identify demographic and medical factors that play a crucial role in predicting all-cause readmissions. As the health claims data is high dimensional, we have used Principal Component Analysis as a dimension reduction technique and used the results for building regression models. We compared and evaluated these models based on the Area Under Curve (AUC) metric. Random Forest model gave the highest performance followed by Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine models. These models can be used to identify the crucial factors causing readmissions and help identify patients to focus on to reduce the chances of readmission, ultimately bringing down the cost and increasing the quality of healthcare provided to the patients.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26200v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While diffusion language models (DLMs) enable fine-grained refinement, their practical controllability remains fragile. We identify and formally characterize a central failure mode called update forgetting, in which uniform and context agnostic updates induce token level fluctuations across timesteps, erasing earlier semantic edits and disrupting the cumulative refinement process, thereby degrading fluency and coherence. As this failure originates in uniform and context agnostic updates, effective control demands explicit token ordering. We propose Token Timestep Allocation (TTA), which realizes soft and semantic token ordering via per token timestep schedules: critical tokens are frozen early, while uncertain tokens receive continued refinement. This timestep based ordering can be instantiated as either a fixed policy or an adaptive policy driven by task signals, thereby supporting a broad spectrum of refinement strategies. Because it operates purely at inference time, it applies uniformly across various DLMs and naturally extends to diverse supervision sources. Empirically, TTA improves controllability and fluency: on sentiment control, it yields more than 20 percent higher accuracy and nearly halves perplexity using less than one fifth the steps; in detoxification, it lowers maximum toxicity (12.2 versus 14.5) and perplexity (26.0 versus 32.0). Together, these results demonstrate that softened ordering via timestep allocation is the critical lever for mitigating update forgetting and achieving stable and controllable diffusion text generation.",

While prior work studies preferences over certain attributes (e.g., length or sycophancy), automatically extracting relevant features without pre-specifying hypotheses remains challenging. We introduce What's In My Human Feedback? (WIMHF), a method to explain feedback data using sparse autoencoders. WIMHF characterizes both (1) the preferences a dataset is capable of measuring and (2) the preferences that the annotators actually express. Across 7 datasets, WIMHF identifies a small number of human-interpretable features that account for the majority of the preference prediction signal achieved by black-box models. These features reveal a wide diversity in what humans prefer, and the role of dataset-level context: for example, users on Reddit prefer informality and jokes, while annotators in HH-RLHF and PRISM disprefer them. WIMHF also surfaces potentially unsafe preferences, such as that LMArena users tend to vote against refusals, often in favor of toxic content. The learned features enable effective data curation: re-labeling the harmful examples in Arena yields large safety gains (+37%) with no cost to general performance. They also allow fine-grained personalization: on the Community Alignment dataset, we learn annotator-specific weights over subjective features that improve preference prediction. WIMHF provides a human-centered analysis method for practitioners to better understand and use preference data.",

Current RAG evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on what we call local RAG: retrieving relevant chunks from a small subset of documents to answer queries that require only localized understanding within specific text chunks. However, many real-world applications require a fundamentally different capability -- global RAG -- which involves aggregating and analyzing information across entire document collections to derive corpus-level insights (for example, \"What are the top 10 most cited papers in 2023?\"). In this paper, we introduce GlobalQA -- the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate global RAG capabilities, covering four core task types: counting, extremum queries, sorting, and top-k extraction. Through systematic evaluation across different models and baselines, we find that existing RAG methods perform poorly on global tasks, with the strongest baseline achieving only 1.51 F1 score. To address these challenges, we propose GlobalRAG, a multi-tool collaborative framework that preserves structural coherence through chunk-level retrieval, incorporates LLM-driven intelligent filters to eliminate noisy documents, and integrates aggregation modules for precise symbolic computation. On the Qwen2.5-14B model, GlobalRAG achieves 6.63 F1 compared to the strongest baseline's 1.51 F1, validating the effectiveness of our method.",

However, when deployed in real-world scenarios, such solutions typically face scalability issues and have to address practical requirements such as full access to original datasets and model. In contrast to the existing approaches, we regard classification training as a sequential process where classes are learned sequentially, which we call \\emph{inductive approach}. Unlearning can then be done by reversing the last training sequence. This is implemented by appending a projection-redistribution layer in the end of the model. Such an approach does not require full access to the original dataset or the model, addressing the challenges of existing methods. This enables modular and model-agnostic deployment as an output filter into existing classification pipelines with minimal alterations. We conducted multiple experiments across multiple datasets including image (CIFAR-10/100 using CNN-based model) and tabular datasets (Covertype using tree-based model). Experiment results show consistently similar output to a fully retrained model with a high computational cost reduction. This demonstrates the applicability, scalability, and system compatibility of our solution while maintaining the performance of the output in a more practical setting.",

Current steering methods, such as vector addition and directional ablation, are constrained within a two-dimensional subspace defined by the activation and feature direction, making them sensitive to chosen parameters and potentially affecting unrelated features due to unintended interactions in activation space. We introduce Angular Steering, a novel and flexible method for behavior modulation that operates by rotating activations within a fixed two-dimensional subspace. By formulating steering as a geometric rotation toward or away from a target behavior direction, Angular Steering provides continuous, fine-grained control over behaviors such as refusal and compliance. We demonstrate this method using refusal steering emotion steering as use cases. Additionally, we propose Adaptive Angular Steering, a selective variant that rotates only activations aligned with the target feature, further enhancing stability and coherence. Angular Steering generalizes existing addition and orthogonalization techniques under a unified geometric rotation framework, simplifying parameter selection and maintaining model stability across a broader range of adjustments. Experiments across multiple model families and sizes show that Angular Steering achieves robust behavioral control while maintaining general language modeling performance, underscoring its flexibility, generalization, and robustness compared to prior approaches.

The process consists of three cycles that incrementally integrate multiple sources of evidence, including collaborative discussions from the FSE 2025 \"Software Engineering 2030\" workshop, rapid literature reviews, and external feedback sessions involving peers. McLuhan's tetrads were used as a conceptual instrument to systematically capture the transforming effects of GenAI on SE processes and software products.The resulting roadmap identifies four fundamental forms of GenAI augmentation in SE and systematically characterizes their related research challenges and opportunities. These insights are then consolidated into a set of future research directions. By grounding the roadmap in a rigorous multi-cycle process and cross-validating it among independent author teams and peers, the study provides a transparent and reproducible foundation for analyzing how GenAI affects SE processes, methods and tools, and for framing future research within this rapidly evolving area.

This capability has driven their application to high-dimensional multi-objective black-box optimization problem. Existing approaches often employ an external optimization loop, such as an evolutionary algorithm, to the diffusion model. However, these approaches treat the diffusion model as a black-box refiner, which overlooks the internal distribution transition of the diffusion generation process, limiting their efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose the Inference-time Multi-target Generation (IMG) algorithm, which optimizes the diffusion process at inference-time to generate samples that simultaneously satisfy multiple objectives. Specifically, our IMG performs weighted resampling during the diffusion generation process according to the expected aggregated multi-objective values. This weighted resampling strategy ensures the diffusion-generated samples are distributed according to our desired multi-target Boltzmann distribution. We further derive that the multi-target Boltzmann distribution has an interesting log-likelihood interpretation, where it is the optimal solution to the distributional multi-objective optimization problem. We implemented IMG for a multi-objective molecule generation task. Experiments show that IMG, requiring only a single generation pass, achieves a significantly higher hypervolume than baseline optimization algorithms that often require hundreds of diffusion generations. Notably, our algorithm can be viewed as an optimized diffusion process and can be integrated into existing methods to further improve their performance.",

In this work, we aim to explain this conflict by exploring how language models manipulate numbers and quantify the lower bounds of accuracy of these mechanisms. We find that despite surfacing errors, different language models learn interchangeable representations of numbers that are systematic, highly accurate and universal across their hidden states and the types of input contexts. This allows us to create universal probes for each LLM and to trace information -- including the causes of output errors -- to specific layers. Our results lay a fundamental understanding of how pre-trained LLMs manipulate numbers and outline the potential of more accurate probing techniques in addressed refinements of LLMs' architectures.",

Prior causal accounts typically model text as a single vector, obscuring token-level structure and leaving core phenomena-such as prompt sensitivity and failures on hard negatives unexplained. We address this gap with a token-aware causal representation learning (CRL) framework grounded in a sequential, language-token SCM. Our theory extends block identifiability to tokenized text, proving that CLIP's contrastive objective can recover the modal-invariant latent variable under both sentence-level and token-level SCMs. Crucially, token granularity yields the first principled explanation of CLIP's compositional brittleness: composition nonidentifiability. We show the existence of pseudo-optimal text encoders that achieve perfect modal-invariant alignment yet are provably insensitive to SWAP, REPLACE, and ADD operations over atomic concepts, thereby failing to distinguish correct captions from hard negatives despite optimizing the same training objective as true-optimal encoders. The analysis further links language-side nonidentifiability to visual-side failures via the modality gap and shows how iterated composition operators compound hardness, motivating improved negative mining strategies.",

In this work, we study the implicit bias of incremental Adam (using one sample per step) for logistic regression on linearly separable data, and we show that its bias can deviate from the full-batch behavior. To illustrate this, we construct a class of structured datasets where incremental Adam provably converges to the $\\ell_2$-max-margin classifier, in contrast to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin bias of full-batch Adam. For general datasets, we develop a proxy algorithm that captures the limiting behavior of incremental Adam as $\\beta_2 \\to 1$ and we characterize its convergence direction via a data-dependent dual fixed-point formulation. Finally, we prove that, unlike Adam, Signum [Bernstein et al., 2018] converges to the $\\ell_\\infty$-max-margin classifier for any batch size by taking $\\beta$ close enough to 1.

Posterior sampling provides an accurate and fair framework for tasks such as inpainting, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, and several heuristics attempt to approximate it. Unfortunately, approximate posterior sampling is computationally intractable in general.\n  To sidestep this hardness, we focus on (local or global) log-concave distributions $p(x)$. In this regime, Langevin dynamics yields posterior samples when the exact scores of $p(x)$ are available, but it is brittle to score--estimation error, requiring an MGF bound (sub-exponential error). By contrast, in the unconditional setting, diffusion models succeed with only an $L^2$ bound on the score error.

To address this, we introduce ACER (Automated Curriculum-Enhanced Regimen) that transforms generalist models into domain experts without sacrificing their broad capabilities. ACER first synthesizes a comprehensive, textbook-style curriculum by generating a table of contents for a subject and then creating question-answer (QA) pairs guided by Bloom's taxonomy. This ensures systematic topic coverage and progressively increasing difficulty. The resulting synthetic corpus is used for continual pretraining with an interleaved curriculum schedule, aligning learning across both content and cognitive dimensions.\n  Experiments with Llama 3.2 (1B and 3B) show significant gains in specialized MMLU subsets. In challenging domains like microeconomics, where baselines struggle, ACER boosts accuracy by 5 percentage points. Across all target domains, we observe a consistent macro-average improvement of 3 percentage points. Notably, ACER not only prevents catastrophic forgetting but also facilitates positive cross-domain knowledge transfer, improving performance on non-target domains by 0.7 points. Beyond MMLU, ACER enhances performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks like ARC and GPQA by over 2 absolute points, while maintaining stable performance on general reasoning tasks.

Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such as signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable information; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character recognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image appears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion (PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that are largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do address text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters, overlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result, scene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in practical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for both text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a vision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives jointly. GLYPH-SR utilizes a Text-SR Fusion ControlNet(TS-ControlNet) guided by OCR data, and a ping-pong scheduler that alternates between text- and scene-centric guidance. To enable targeted text restoration, we train these components on a synthetic corpus while keeping the main SR branch frozen. Across SVT, SCUT-CTW1500, and CUTE80 at x4, and x8, GLYPH-SR improves OCR F1 by up to +15.18 percentage points over diffusion/GAN baseline (SVT x8, OpenOCR) while maintaining competitive MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, and MUSIQ.

In this paper, we introduce a novel concept in causal discovery, termed interventional constraints, which differs fundamentally from interventional data. While interventional data require direct perturbations of variables, interventional constraints encode high-level causal knowledge in the form of inequality constraints on causal effects. For instance, in the Sachs dataset (Sachs et al.\\ 2005), Akt has been shown to be activated by PIP3, meaning PIP3 exerts a positive causal effect on Akt. Existing causal discovery methods allow enforcing structural constraints (for example, requiring a causal path from PIP3 to Akt), but they may still produce incorrect causal conclusions such as learning that \"PIP3 inhibits Akt\". Interventional constraints bridge this gap by explicitly constraining the total causal effect between variable pairs, ensuring learned models respect known causal influences. To formalize interventional constraints, we propose a metric to quantify total causal effects for linear causal models and formulate the problem as a constrained optimization task, solved using a two-stage constrained optimization method. We evaluate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate that integrating interventional constraints not only improves model accuracy and ensures consistency with established findings, making models more explainable, but also facilitates the discovery of new causal relationships that would otherwise be costly to identify.",

We investigate the impact of synthetic data generation and lightweight fine-tuning techniques on the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize fallacious arguments using the MISSCI dataset and framework. In this work, we propose MisSynth, a pipeline that applies retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to produce synthetic fallacy samples, which are then used to fine-tune an LLM model. Our results show substantial accuracy gains with fine-tuned models compared to vanilla baselines. For instance, the LLaMA 3.1 8B fine-tuned model achieved an over 35% F1-score absolute improvement on the MISSCI test split over its vanilla baseline. We demonstrate that introducing synthetic fallacy data to augment limited annotated resources can significantly enhance zero-shot LLM classification performance on real-world scientific misinformation tasks, even with limited computational resources.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26347v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed to optimize problem-solving by learning actions that maximize rewards, a task that becomes particularly challenging in random and nonstationary environments. Even advanced RL algorithms are often limited in their ability to solve problems in these conditions. In applications such as searching for underwater pollution clouds with autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), RL algorithms must navigate reward-sparse environments, where actions frequently result in a zero reward. This paper aims to address these challenges by revisiting and modifying classical RL approaches to efficiently operate in sparse, randomized, and nonstationary environments. We systematically study a large number of modifications, including hierarchical algorithm changes, multigoal learning, and the integration of a location memory as an external output filter to prevent state revisits. Our results demonstrate that a modified Monte Carlo-based approach significantly outperforms traditional Q-learning and two exhaustive search patterns, illustrating its potential in adapting RL to complex environments. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning approaches can be effectively adapted for use in random, nonstationary, and reward-sparse environments.",

However, forming optimal teams is a significant challenge, as the inherent opacity of most models obscures the internal characteristics necessary for effective collaboration. In this paper, we propose an interaction-centric framework for automatic team composition that does not require any prior knowledge including their internal architectures, training data, or task performances. Our method constructs a \"language model graph\" that maps relationships between models from the semantic coherence of pairwise conversations, and then applies community detection to identify synergistic model clusters. Our experiments with diverse LLMs demonstrate that the proposed method discovers functionally coherent groups that reflect their latent specializations. Priming conversations with specific topics identified synergistic teams which outperform random baselines on downstream benchmarks and achieve comparable accuracy to that of manually-curated teams based on known model specializations. Our findings provide a new basis for the automated design of collaborative multi-agent LLM teams.",

While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.",

In contrast, imitation learning (IL) is easy to train but often underperforms due to its offline nature. In this paper, we propose Hi-ORS, a simple yet effective post-training method that utilizes rejection sampling to achieve both training stability and high robustness. Hi-ORS stabilizes value estimation by filtering out negatively rewarded samples during online fine-tuning, and adopts a reward-weighted supervised training objective to provide dense intermediate-step supervision. For systematic study, we develop an asynchronous inference-training framework that supports flexible online human-in-the-loop corrections, which serve as explicit guidance for learning error-recovery behaviors. Across three real-world tasks and two embodiments, Hi-ORS fine-tunes a pi-base policy to master contact-rich manipulation in just 1.5 hours of real-world training, outperforming RL and IL baselines by a substantial margin in both effectiveness and efficiency.

However, unauthorized commercial use of these datasets severely violates the intellectual property rights of dataset owners. Existing backdoor-based dataset ownership verification methods suffer from inherent limitations: poison-label watermarks are easily detectable due to label inconsistencies, while clean-label watermarks face high technical complexity and failure on high-resolution images. Moreover, both approaches employ static watermark patterns that are vulnerable to detection and removal. To address these issues, this paper proposes a sample-specific clean-label backdoor watermarking (i.e., SSCL-BW). By training a U-Net-based watermarked sample generator, this method generates unique watermarks for each sample, fundamentally overcoming the vulnerability of static watermark patterns. The core innovation lies in designing a composite loss function with three components: target sample loss ensures watermark effectiveness, non-target sample loss guarantees trigger reliability, and perceptual similarity loss maintains visual imperceptibility. During ownership verification, black-box testing is employed to check whether suspicious models exhibit predefined backdoor behaviors. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its robustness against potential watermark removal attacks.",

In such cases, we observe that the performance of GC deteriorates significantly, while existing robust graph learning technologies offer only limited effectiveness. Through both empirical investigation and theoretical analysis, we reveal that GC is inherently an intrinsic-dimension-reducing process, synthesizing a condensed graph with lower classification complexity. Although this property is critical for effective GC performance, it remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To tackle this vulnerability and improve GC robustness, we adopt the geometry perspective of graph data manifold and propose a novel Manifold-constrained Robust Graph Condensation framework named MRGC. Specifically, we introduce three graph data manifold learning modules that guide the condensed graph to lie within a smooth, low-dimensional manifold with minimal class ambiguity, thereby preserving the classification complexity reduction capability of GC and ensuring robust performance under universal adversarial attacks.

However, existing models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored.

To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues.

However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew effect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

While recent LLM-based approaches improve over static templates, they still generate noisy, fragmented graphs with duplicate nodes due to the absence of guided extraction and coreference resolution. The recently proposed CORE-KG framework addresses these limitations by integrating a type-aware coreference module and domain-guided structured prompts, significantly reducing node duplication and legal noise. In this work, we present a systematic ablation study of CORE-KG to quantify the individual contributions of its two key components. Our results show that removing coreference resolution results in a 28.32% increase in node duplication and a 4.32% increase in noisy nodes, while removing structured prompts leads to a 4.34% increase in node duplication and a 73.33% increase in noisy nodes.

We show that such collections of relation decoders can be highly compressed by simple order-3 tensor networks without significant loss in decoding accuracy. To explain this surprising redundancy, we develop a cross-evaluation protocol, in which we apply each linear decoder operator to the subjects of every other relation. Our results reveal that these linear maps do not encode distinct relations, but extract recurring, coarse-grained semantic properties (e.g., country of capital city and country of food are both in the country-of-X property). This property-centric structure clarifies both the operators' compressibility and highlights why they generalize only to new relations that are semantically close. Our findings thus interpret linear relational decoding in transformer language models as primarily property-based, rather than relation-specific.",

Among calibration notions in multiclass classification, strong calibration is the most stringent, as it requires all predicted probabilities to be simultaneously calibrated across all classes. However, existing approaches to multiclass calibration lack a notion of distance among inputs, which makes them vulnerable to proximity bias: predictions in sparse regions of the feature space are systematically miscalibrated. This is especially relevant in high-stakes settings, such as healthcare, where the sparse instances are exactly those most at risk of biased treatment. In this work, we address this main shortcoming by introducing a local perspective on multiclass calibration. First, we formally define multiclass local calibration and establish its relationship with strong calibration. Second, we theoretically analyze the pitfalls of existing evaluation metrics when applied to multiclass local calibration. Third, we propose a practical method for enhancing local calibration in Neural Networks, which enforces alignment between predicted probabilities and local estimates of class frequencies using the Jensen-Shannon distance.

At its very core, CSR is about finding a prior that can be used to extrapolate frequencies in a micrograph that have never been imaged by the image-generating microscope. It stands to reason that, with the advent of better data-driven machine learning techniques, stronger prior can be learned and hence CSR can lead to better results. Here, we present ResMatching, a novel CSR method that uses guided conditional flow matching to learn such improved data-priors. We evaluate ResMatching on 4 diverse biological structures from the BioSR dataset and compare its results against 7 baselines. ResMatching consistently achieves competitive results, demonstrating in all cases the best trade-off between data fidelity and perceptual realism. We observe that CSR using ResMatching is particularly effective in cases where a strong prior is hard to learn, e.g. when the given low-resolution images contain a lot of noise. Additionally, we show that ResMatching can be used to sample from an implicitly learned posterior distribution and that this distribution is calibrated for all tested use-cases, enabling our method to deliver a pixel-wise data-uncertainty term that can guide future users to reject uncertain predictions.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.26616v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: We introduce Aeolus, a large-scale Multi-modal Flight Delay Dataset designed to advance research on flight delay prediction and support the development of foundation models for tabular data. Existing datasets in this domain are typically limited to flat tabular structures and fail to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in delay propagation. Aeolus addresses this limitation by providing three aligned modalities: (i) a tabular dataset with rich operational, meteorological, and airportlevel features for over 50 million flights; (ii) a flight chain module that models delay propagation along sequential flight legs, capturing upstream and downstream dependencies; and (iii) a flight network graph that encodes shared aircraft, crew, and airport resource connections, enabling cross-flight relational reasoning. The dataset is carefully constructed with temporal splits, comprehensive features, and strict leakage prevention to support realistic and reproducible machine learning evaluation. Aeolus supports a broad range of tasks, including regression, classification, temporal structure modeling, and graph learning, serving as a unified benchmark across tabular, sequential, and graph modalities. We release baseline experiments and preprocessing tools to facilitate adoption. Aeolus fills a key gap for both domain-specific modeling and general-purpose structured data research.Our source code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/Flnny/Delay-data",

However, in data-sensitive fields such as healthcare, the lack of high-quality, domain-specific training corpus hinders LLMs' adaptation for specialized applications. Meanwhile, domain experts have distilled domain wisdom into ontology rules, which formalize relationships among concepts and ensure the integrity of knowledge management repositories. Viewing LLMs as implicit repositories of human knowledge, we propose Evontree, a novel framework that leverages a small set of high-quality ontology rules to systematically extract, validate, and enhance domain knowledge within LLMs, without requiring extensive external datasets. Specifically, Evontree extracts domain ontology from raw models, detects inconsistencies using two core ontology rules, and reinforces the refined knowledge via self-distilled fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on medical QA benchmarks with Llama3-8B-Instruct and Med42-v2 demonstrate consistent outperformance over both unmodified models and leading supervised baselines, achieving up to a 3.7% improvement in accuracy.

In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.\n  Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from \"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., \"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.",

A common practice is to run the MU algorithm multiple times independently starting from the same trained model.

Existing OTA-FL designs largely enforce zero-bias model updates by either assuming \\emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) or forcing zero-bias updates to guarantee convergence. Under \\emph{heterogeneous} wireless scenarios, however, such designs are constrained by the weakest device and inflate the update variance. Moreover, prior analyses of biased OTA-FL largely address convex objectives, while most modern AI models are highly non-convex. Motivated by these gaps, we study OTA-FL with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for general smooth non-convex objectives under wireless heterogeneity. We develop novel OTA-FL SGD updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias while facilitating reduced variance updates. We derive a finite-time stationarity bound (expected time average squared gradient norm) that explicitly reveals a bias-variance trade-off. To optimize this trade-off, we pose a non-convex joint OTA power-control design and develop an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that requires only statistical CSI at the base station. Experiments on a non-convex image classification task validate the approach: the SCA-based design accelerates convergence via an optimized bias and improves generalization over prior OTA-FL baselines.",

To mitigate this, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures activate only a small portion of parameters during inference, significantly lowering both memory demand and computational overhead. However, conventional MoE inference approaches, which select active experts independently at each layer, often introduce considerable latency because of frequent parameter transfers between host and GPU memory. In addition, current cross-layer prediction strategies, which are typically based on fixed steps, lack adaptability across different hardware platforms and workloads, thereby reducing their robustness and effectiveness.\n  To address these challenges, we present ExpertFlow, a runtime system for MoE inference that combines adaptive expert prefetching and cache-aware routing. ExpertFlow continuously adjusts its prediction horizon for expert activation by leveraging runtime statistics such as transfer bandwidth, parameter dimensionality, and model feedback signals. Furthermore, it incorporates a hybrid cross-layer prediction scheme that fuses pregating information with intermediate computational states to anticipate future expert needs. By adaptively refining prefetching decisions and aligning them with actual usage behavior, ExpertFlow effectively decreases cache misses and removes latency caused by expert swap-ins. Our evaluation demonstrates that ExpertFlow reduces model stall time to less than 0.1% of the baseline, highlighting its capability to optimize MoE inference under stringent memory constraints.",

Our approach leverages the action-value (Q-)function to balance efficiency and fairness without requiring additional training. Specifically, our method computes a local fairness gain for each action and introduces a counterfactual advantage correction term to discourage over-allocation to already well-off agents. This approach is formalized within a centralized control setting, where an arbitrator uses the GIFF-modified Q-values to solve an allocation problem.\n  Empirical evaluations across diverse domains, including dynamic ridesharing, homelessness prevention, and a complex job allocation task-demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms strong baselines and can discover far-sighted, equitable policies. The framework's effectiveness is supported by a theoretical foundation; we prove its fairness surrogate is a principled lower bound on the true fairness improvement and that its trade-off parameter offers monotonic tuning. Our findings establish GIFF as a robust and principled framework for leveraging standard reinforcement learning components to achieve more equitable outcomes in complex multi-agent systems.",

We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.\n  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.\n  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",

However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%.

To address this, we propose two advanced sampling techniques based on features and logits. These samplers select a small yet representative subset of the entire dataset by considering the stochastic distribution of features or logits, thereby enhancing the accuracy of IF estimations. We validate our approach through class removal experiments, a typical application of IFs, using the F1-score to measure how effectively the model forgets the removed class while maintaining inference consistency on the remaining classes.

Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment. GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks, GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",

Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning.

AutoLibra accomplishes this by grounding feedback to an agent's behavior, clustering similar positive and negative behaviors, and creating concrete metrics with clear definitions and concrete examples, which can be used for prompting LLM-as-a-Judge as evaluators. We further propose two meta metrics to evaluate the alignment of a set of (induced) metrics with open feedback: \"coverage\" and \"redundancy\". Through optimizing these meta-metrics, we experimentally demonstrate AutoLibra's ability to induce more concrete agent evaluation metrics than the ones proposed in previous agent evaluation benchmarks and discover new metrics to analyze agents. We also present two applications of AutoLibra in agent improvement: First, we show that AutoLibra serve human prompt engineers for diagonalize agent failures and improve prompts iterative. Moreover, we find that AutoLibra can induce metrics for automatic optimization for agents, which makes agents improve through self-regulation. Our results suggest that AutoLibra is a powerful task-agnostic tool for evaluating and improving language agents.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.10361v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Agents are minimally entities that are influenced by their past observations and act to influence future observations. This latter capacity is captured by empowerment, which has served as a vital framing concept across artificial intelligence and cognitive science. This former capacity, however, is equally foundational: In what ways, and to what extent, can an agent be influenced by what it observes? In this paper, we ground this concept in a universal agent-centric measure that we refer to as plasticity, and reveal a fundamental connection to empowerment. Following a set of desiderata on a suitable definition, we define plasticity using a new information-theoretic quantity we call the generalized directed information. We show that this new quantity strictly generalizes the directed information introduced by Massey (1990) while preserving all of its desirable properties. Under this definition, we find that plasticity is well thought of as the mirror of empowerment: The two concepts are defined using the same measure, with only the direction of influence reversed. Our main result establishes a tension between the plasticity and empowerment of an agent, suggesting that agent design needs to be mindful of both characteristics. We explore the implications of these findings, and suggest that plasticity, empowerment, and their relationship are essential to understanding agency",

Verification plays a key role in TTS, simultaneously influencing (1) reasoning performance and (2) compute efficiency, due to the quality and computational cost of verification. In this work, we challenge the conventional paradigms of verification, and make the first attempt toward systematically investigating the impact of verification granularity-that is, how frequently the verifier is invoked during generation, beyond verifying only the final output or individual generation steps. To this end, we introduce Variable Granularity Search (VG-Search), a unified algorithm that generalizes beam search and Best-of-N sampling via a tunable granularity parameter g. Extensive experiments with VG-Search under varying compute budgets, generator-verifier configurations, and task attributes reveal that dynamically selecting g can improve the compute efficiency and scaling behavior. Building on these findings, we propose adaptive VG-Search strategies that achieve accuracy gains of up to 3.1\\% over Beam Search and 3.6\\% over Best-of-N, while reducing FLOPs by over 52\\%.

However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains.

A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.",

We contend that navigating these inconsistencies, by treating metrics as divergent objectives, yields three key benefits: (1) Normative Pluralism: Maintaining a full suite of potentially contradictory metrics ensures that the diverse moral stances and stakeholder values inherent in RAI are adequately represented. (2) Epistemological Completeness: The use of multiple, sometimes conflicting, metrics allows for a more comprehensive capture of multifaceted ethical concepts, thereby preserving greater informational fidelity about these concepts than any single, simplified definition. (3) Implicit Regularization: Jointly optimizing for theoretically conflicting objectives discourages overfitting to one specific metric, steering models towards solutions with enhanced generalization and robustness under real-world complexities. In contrast, efforts to enforce theoretical consistency by simplifying or pruning metrics risk narrowing this value diversity, losing conceptual depth, and degrading model performance. We therefore advocate for a shift in RAI theory and practice: from getting trapped in inconsistency to characterizing acceptable inconsistency thresholds and elucidating the mechanisms that permit robust, approximated consistency in practice.",

Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they \"understand\" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.",

While human feedback is essential for improving data quality, it is costly and does not scale well. In this paper, we introduce Refine-n-Judge, an automated iterative approach that leverages a single LLM as both a refiner and a judge to enhance dataset quality. Unlike existing iterative refinement methods, Refine-n-Judge employs an LLM to both generate refinements and explicitly evaluate each improvement, ensuring that every iteration meaningfully enhances the dataset without requiring additional human annotation or a separate reward model. At each step, the LLM refines a response and judges whether the refinement is an improvement over the previous answer. This process continues until the LLM prefers the initial answer over the refinement, indicating no further improvements. This produces sequences of increasing quality, preference-labeled responses ideal for fine-tuning.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of Refine-n-Judge across a range of public datasets spanning five corpora, targeting tasks such as coding, math, and conversation. Models (Llama 3.1-8B and Llama 3.3-70B) fine-tuned on Refine-n-Judge-enhanced datasets were preferred by LLM judges in over 74% of comparisons against models tuned on the original dataset by GPT-4. Additionally, we report performance gains: +5% on AlpacaEval and AlpacaEval 2.0, and +19% on MT-Bench.

The proposed task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth (unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks.

In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.",

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on such tasks, they treat MLLMs solely as encoders, overlooking their generative capacity. However, such an encoding paradigm becomes less effective as instructions become more complex and require compositional reasoning. Inspired by the proven effectiveness of chain-of-thought reasoning, we propose a general Think-Then-Embed (TTE) framework for UME, composed of a reasoner and an embedder. The reasoner MLLM first generates reasoning traces that explain complex queries, followed by an embedder that produces representations conditioned on both the original query and the intermediate reasoning. This explicit reasoning step enables more nuanced understanding of complex multimodal instructions. Our contributions are threefold. First, by leveraging a powerful MLLM reasoner, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the MMEB-V2 benchmark, surpassing proprietary models trained on massive in-house datasets. Second, to reduce the dependency on large MLLM reasoners, we finetune a smaller MLLM reasoner using high-quality embedding-centric reasoning traces, achieving the best performance among open-source models with a 7% absolute gain over recently proposed models. Third, we investigate strategies for integrating the reasoner and embedder into a unified model for improved efficiency without sacrificing performance.",

LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead.

However, these models face a fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language, risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality, introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines over expert knowledge.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23595v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.",

However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2305.17608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The extraordinary capabilities of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 are in part unleashed by aligning them with reward models that are trained on human preferences, which are often represented as rankings of responses to prompts. In this paper, we document the phenomenon of \\textit{reward collapse}, an empirical observation where the prevailing ranking-based approach results in an \\textit{identical} reward distribution \\textit{regardless} of the prompts during the terminal phase of training. This outcome is undesirable as open-ended prompts like ``write a short story about your best friend'' should yield a continuous range of rewards for their completions, while specific prompts like ``what is the capital of New Zealand'' should generate either high or low rewards. Our theoretical investigation reveals that reward collapse is primarily due to the insufficiency of the ranking-based objective function to incorporate prompt-related information during optimization. This insight allows us to derive closed-form expressions for the reward distribution associated with a set of utility functions in an asymptotic regime. To overcome reward collapse, we introduce a prompt-aware optimization scheme that provably admits a prompt-dependent reward distribution within the interpolating regime. Our experimental results suggest that our proposed prompt-aware utility functions significantly alleviate reward collapse during the training of reward models.",

However, users without technical expertise often turn to (untrustworthy) third-party services, such as prompt engineering, to enhance their LLM experience, creating vulnerabilities to adversarial threats like backdoor attacks. Backdoor-compromised LLMs generate malicious outputs to users when inputs contain specific \"triggers\" set by attackers. Traditional defense strategies, originally designed for small-scale models, are impractical for API-accessible LLMs due to limited model access, high computational costs, and data requirements. To address these limitations, we propose Chain-of-Scrutiny (CoS) which leverages LLMs' unique reasoning abilities to mitigate backdoor attacks. It guides the LLM to generate reasoning steps for a given input and scrutinizes for consistency with the final output -- any inconsistencies indicating a potential attack. It is well-suited for the popular API-only LLM deployments, enabling detection at minimal cost and with little data. User-friendly and driven by natural language, it allows non-experts to perform the defense independently while maintaining transparency.

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.08525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling complex relationships in large-scale datasets. However, their black-box nature poses trustworthiness challenges. In certain situations, ensuring trust in predictions might require following specific partial monotonicity constraints. However, certifying if an already-trained ANN is partially monotonic is challenging. Therefore, ANNs are often disregarded in some critical applications, such as credit scoring, where partial monotonicity is required. To address this challenge, this paper presents a novel algorithm (LipVor) that certifies if a black-box model, such as an ANN, is positive based on a finite number of evaluations. Consequently, since partial monotonicity can be expressed as a positivity condition on partial derivatives, LipVor can certify whether an ANN is partially monotonic. To do so, for every positively evaluated point, the Lipschitzianity of the black-box model is used to construct a specific neighborhood where the function remains positive. Next, based on the Voronoi diagram of the evaluated points, a sufficient condition is stated to certify if the function is positive in the domain. Unlike prior methods, our approach certifies partial monotonicity without constrained architectures or piece-wise linear activations. Therefore, LipVor could open up the possibility of using unconstrained ANN in some critical fields. Moreover, some other properties of an ANN, such as convexity, can be posed as positivity conditions, and therefore, LipVor could also be applied.",

Together, these findings reveal how AI participation reorganizes the distributed cognitive architecture of teams: AI systems function as implicit social forcefields. Our findings highlight the double-edged impact of AI: the same mechanisms that enable efficient collaboration can also erode epistemic diversity and undermine natural alignment processes.

Consider, for example, generating electricity demand patterns with constraints on peak demand times. This can be used to stress-test the functioning of power grids during adverse weather conditions. Existing approaches for generating constrained time series are either not scalable or degrade sample quality. To address these challenges, we introduce Constrained Posterior Sampling (CPS), a diffusion-based sampling algorithm that aims to project the posterior mean estimate into the constraint set after each denoising update. Notably, CPS scales to a large number of constraints ($\\sim100$) without requiring additional training.

To address this, we introduce PGED (Preference Graph Ensemble and Denoise), a novel approach that leverages multiple model-based evaluators to construct preference graphs, and then ensembles and denoises these graphs for acyclic, non-contradictory evaluation results. We provide theoretical guarantees for our framework, demonstrating its efficacy in recovering the ground truth preference structure. Extensive experiments on ten benchmarks demonstrate PGED 's superiority in three applications: 1) model ranking for evaluation, 2) response selection for test-time scaling, and 3) data selection for model fine-tuning.

While there have been significant advances in machine-learning approaches to translate periods of raw sensor data to model momentary behaviors, (e.g., physical activity recognition), there still remains a significant gap in the translation of these sensing streams into meaningful, high-level, context-aware insights that are required for various applications (e.g., summarizing an individual's daily routine). To bridge this gap, experts often need to employ a context-driven sensemaking process in real-world studies to derive insights. This process often requires manual effort and can be challenging even for experienced researchers due to the complexity of human behaviors.\n  We conducted three rounds of user studies with 21 experts to explore solutions to address challenges with sensemaking. We follow a human-centered design process to identify needs and design, iterate, build, and evaluate Vital Insight (VI), a novel, LLM-assisted, prototype system to enable human-in-the-loop inference (sensemaking) and visualizations of multi-modal passive sensing data from smartphones and wearables. Using the prototype as a technology probe, we observe experts' interactions with it and develop an expert sensemaking model that explains how experts move between direct data representations and AI-supported inferences to explore, question, and validate insights.

Modeling the 3D deformations caused by various actions has been a major challenge. Fortunately, advancements in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for dynamic human modeling offer new possibilities. In this paper, we introduce UV-Attack, a groundbreaking approach that achieves high success rates even with extensive and unseen human actions. We address the challenge above by leveraging dynamic-NeRF-based UV mapping. UV-Attack can generate human images across diverse actions and viewpoints, and even create novel actions by sampling from the SMPL parameter space. While dynamic NeRF models are capable of modeling human bodies, modifying clothing textures is challenging because they are embedded in neural network parameters. To tackle this, UV-Attack generates UV maps instead of RGB images and modifies the texture stacks. This approach enables real-time texture edits and makes the attack more practical. We also propose a novel Expectation over Pose Transformation loss (EoPT) to improve the evasion success rate on unseen poses and views. Our experiments show that UV-Attack achieves a 92.7% attack success rate against the FastRCNN model across varied poses in dynamic video settings, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art AdvCamou attack, which only had a 28.5% ASR. Moreover, we achieve 49.5% ASR on the latest YOLOv8 detector in black-box settings.

Extensive experiments show that the proposed method notably boosts performance across domain-undetermined data and a series of foundational downstream tasks when applied to various advanced LLMs. We release our code and hope this study can shed light on the understanding of data diversity and advance feedback-driven data-model co-design for LLMs.",

We introduce Self-Taught Lookahead (STL), a reward-free framework that improves language model-based value functions by reasoning explicitly about state transitions. STL can be viewed as a chain-of-thought analogue of the value iteration algorithm: instead of regressing directly on numeric values, a value LLM is trained to simulate a step of lookahead in natural language - predicting the next action, resulting state, and rationale for its value, thereby refining value estimates without any labeled data. This self-supervised procedure yields more accurate state-value predictions, which in turn enable lightweight search algorithms to expand fewer states while maintaining strong performance. Empirically, STL-trained value models built on moderately sized (8B parameter) open-weight LLMs boost web agent success rates by 39%, achieving comparable performance with proprietary models. STL also generalizes to multi-hop QA and math puzzles. We find that STL enables small open-source models to guide efficient search, reducing inference costs by integrating explicit reasoning with value learning.",

    "title": "Guided Model Merging for Hybrid Data Learning: Leveraging Centralized Data to Refine Decentralized Models",
    "summary": "arXiv:2503.20138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Current network training paradigms primarily focus on either centralized or decentralized data regimes. However, in practice, data availability often exhibits a hybrid nature, where both regimes coexist. This hybrid setting presents new opportunities for model training, as the two regimes offer complementary trade-offs: decentralized data is abundant but subject to heterogeneity and communication constraints, while centralized data, though limited in volume and potentially unrepresentative, enables better curation and high-throughput access. Despite its potential, effectively combining these paradigms remains challenging, and few frameworks are tailored to hybrid data regimes. To address this, we propose a novel framework that constructs a model atlas from decentralized models and leverages centralized data to refine a global model within this structured space. The refined model is then used to reinitialize the decentralized models. Our method synergizes federated learning (to exploit decentralized data) and model merging (to utilize centralized data), enabling effective training under hybrid data availability. Theoretically, we show that our approach achieves faster convergence than methods relying solely on decentralized data, due to variance reduction in the merging process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms purely centralized, purely decentralized, and existing hybrid-adaptable methods. Notably, our method remains robust even when the centralized and decentralized data domains differ or when decentralized data contains noise, significantly broadening its applicability.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.01001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As language models improve and become capable of performing more complex tasks across modalities, evaluating them automatically becomes increasingly challenging. Developing strong and robust task-specific automatic metrics gets harder, and human-annotated test sets -- which are expensive to create -- saturate more quickly. A compelling alternative is to design reliable strategies to automate the creation of test data and evaluation, but previous attempts either rely on pre-existing data, or focus solely on individual tasks. We present Zero-shot Benchmarking (ZSB), a framework for creating high-quality benchmarks for any task by leveraging language models for both synthetic test data creation and evaluation. ZSB is simple and flexible: it requires only the creation of a prompt for data generation and one for evaluation; it is scalable to tasks and languages where collecting real-world data is costly or impractical; it is model-agnostic, allowing the creation of increasingly challenging benchmarks as models improve. To assess the effectiveness of our framework, we create benchmarks for five text-only tasks and a multi-modal one: general capabilities in four languages (English, Chinese, French, and Korean), translation, and general vision-language capabilities in English. We then rank a broad range of open and closed systems on our benchmarks. ZSB rankings consistently correlate strongly with human rankings, outperforming widely-adopted standard benchmarks. Through ablations, we find that strong benchmarks can be created with open models, and that judge model size and dataset variety are crucial drivers of performance. We release all our benchmarks, and code to reproduce our experiments and to produce new benchmarks.",

This has created a disparity in the quality of automatic evaluation methods for non-English languages, ultimately hindering the development of models with better multilingual capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce M-Prometheus, a suite of open-weight LLM judges ranging from 3B to 14B parameters that can provide both direct assessment and pairwise comparison feedback on multilingual outputs. M-Prometheus models outperform state-of-the-art open LLM judges on multilingual reward benchmarks spanning more than 20 languages, as well as on literary machine translation (MT) evaluation covering 4 language pairs. Furthermore, M-Prometheus models can be leveraged at decoding time to significantly improve generated outputs across all 3 tested languages, showcasing their utility for the development of better multilingual models. Lastly, through extensive ablations, we identify the key factors for obtaining an effective multilingual judge, including backbone model selection and training on synthetic multilingual feedback data instead of translated data.

The recent emergence of Vision Language Models (VLMs) as transformative technologies offers significant potential for enabling open-ended video understanding, reasoning, and analytics. Nevertheless, their limited context windows present challenges when processing ultra-long video content, which is prevalent in real-world applications. To address this, we introduce AVA, a VLM-powered system designed for open-ended, advanced video analytics. AVA incorporates two key innovations: (1) the near real-time construction of Event Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) for efficient indexing of long or continuous video streams, and (2) an agentic retrieval-generation mechanism that leverages EKGs to handle complex and diverse queries. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks, LVBench and VideoMME-Long, demonstrate that AVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining 62.3% and 64.1% accuracy, respectively-significantly surpassing existing VLM and video Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Furthermore, to evaluate video analytics in ultra-long and open-world video scenarios, we introduce a new benchmark, AVA-100. This benchmark comprises 8 videos, each exceeding 10 hours in duration, along with 120 manually annotated, diverse, and complex question-answer pairs. On AVA-100, AVA achieves top-tier performance with an accuracy of 75.8%. The source code of AVA is available at https://github.com/I-ESC/Project-Ava.

However, their deployment entails a range of risks and challenges that require careful evaluation. To date, there has been a lack of comprehensive, interdisciplinary studies offering a systematic comparison between open-source and proprietary (closed) generative AI systems, particularly regarding their respective advantages and drawbacks. This study aims to: i) critically evaluate and compare the characteristics, opportunities, and challenges of open and closed generative AI models; and ii) propose foundational elements for the development of an Open, Public, and Safe Gen AI framework. As a methodology, we adopted a combined approach that integrates three methods: literature review, critical analysis, and comparative analysis. The proposed framework outlines key dimensions, openness, public governance, and security, as essential pillars for shaping the future of trustworthy and inclusive Gen AI. Our findings reveal that open models offer greater transparency, auditability, and flexibility, enabling independent scrutiny and bias mitigation. In contrast, closed systems often provide better technical support and ease of implementation, but at the cost of unequal access, accountability, and ethical oversight. The research also highlights the importance of multi-stakeholder governance, environmental sustainability, and regulatory frameworks in ensuring responsible development.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.12191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has become a powerful solution to extract rich representations from unlabeled data. Yet, SSL research is mostly focused on clean, curated and high-quality datasets. As a result, applying SSL on noisy data remains a challenge, despite being crucial to applications such as astrophysics, medical imaging, geophysics or finance. In this work, we present a fully self-supervised framework that enables noise-robust representation learning without requiring a denoiser at inference or downstream fine-tuning. Our method first trains an SSL denoiser on noisy data, then uses it to construct a denoised-to-noisy data curriculum (i.e., training first on denoised, then noisy samples) for pretraining a SSL backbone (e.g., DINOv2), combined with a teacher-guided regularization that anchors noisy embeddings to their denoised counterparts. This process encourages the model to internalize noise robustness. Notably, the denoiser can be discarded after pretraining, simplifying deployment. On ImageNet-1k with ViT-B under extreme Gaussian noise ($\\sigma=255$, SNR = 0.72 dB), our method improves linear probing accuracy by 4.8% over DINOv2, demonstrating that denoiser-free robustness can emerge from noise-aware pretraining.

However, due to the nondeterminism of abduction, the training process often suffers from instability, especially when the knowledge base is large and complex, resulting in a prohibitively large abduction space. While prior works focus on improving candidate selection within this space, they typically treat the knowledge base as a static black box. In this work, we propose Curriculum Abductive Learning (C-ABL), a method that explicitly leverages the internal structure of the knowledge base to address the ABL training challenges. C-ABL partitions the knowledge base into a sequence of sub-bases, progressively introduced during training. This reduces the abduction space throughout training and enables the model to incorporate logic in a stepwise, smooth way. Experiments across multiple tasks show that C-ABL outperforms previous ABL implementations, significantly improves training stability, convergence speed, and final accuracy, especially under complex knowledge setting.",

Although model performance has improved under the training scaling law, significant challenges remain, particularly with respect to training algorithms, such as catastrophic forgetting, and the limited availability of novel training data. As an alternative, test-time scaling enhances reasoning performance by increasing test-time computation without parameter updating. Unlike prior methods in this paradigm focused on token space, we propose leveraging latent space for more effective reasoning and better adherence to the test-time scaling law. We introduce LatentSeek, a novel framework that enhances LLM reasoning through Test-Time Instance-level Adaptation (TTIA) within the model's latent space. Specifically, LatentSeek leverages policy gradient to iteratively update latent representations, guided by self-generated reward signals. LatentSeek is evaluated on a range of reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, across multiple LLM architectures. Results show that LatentSeek consistently outperforms strong baselines, such as Chain-of-Thought prompting and fine-tuning-based methods. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that LatentSeek is highly efficient, typically converging within a few iterations for problems of average complexity, while also benefiting from additional iterations, thereby highlighting the potential of test-time scaling in the latent space. These findings position LatentSeek as a lightweight, scalable, and effective solution for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",

While existing constructive NCO methods typically follow an appending-based paradigm that sequentially adds unvisited nodes to partial solutions, this rigid approach often leads to suboptimal results. To overcome this limitation, we explore the idea of insertion-based paradigm and propose Learning to Construct with Insertion-based Paradigm (L2C-Insert), a novel learning-based method for constructive NCO. Unlike traditional approaches, L2C-Insert builds solutions by strategically inserting unvisited nodes at any valid position in the current partial solution, which can significantly enhance the flexibility and solution quality. The proposed framework introduces three key components: a novel model architecture for precise insertion position prediction, an efficient training scheme for model optimization, and an advanced inference technique that fully exploits the insertion paradigm's flexibility. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world instances of the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) demonstrate that L2C-Insert consistently achieves superior performance across various problem sizes.",

However, this performance gain comes at the cost of a substantial increase in redundant reasoning during the generation process, leading to high computational overhead and exacerbating the issue of overthinking. Although numerous existing approaches aim to address the problem of overthinking, they often rely on external interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Self-Braking Tuning (SBT), which tackles overthinking from the perspective of allowing the model to regulate its own reasoning process, thus eliminating the reliance on external control mechanisms. We construct a set of overthinking identification metrics based on standard answers and design a systematic method to detect redundant reasoning. This method accurately identifies unnecessary steps within the reasoning trajectory and generates training signals for learning self-regulation behaviors. Building on this foundation, we develop a complete strategy for constructing data with adaptive reasoning lengths and introduce an innovative braking prompt mechanism that enables the model to naturally learn when to terminate reasoning at an appropriate point. Experiments across mathematical benchmarks (AIME, AMC, MATH500, GSM8K) demonstrate that our method reduces token consumption by up to 60% while maintaining comparable accuracy to unconstrained models.",

Pragmatic metacognitive prompting (PMP) is a cognition-inspired technique that has been used for pragmatic reasoning. In this paper, we harness PMP for explainable sarcasm detection for Australian and Indian English, alongside a benchmark dataset for standard English. We manually add sarcasm explanations to an existing sarcasm-labeled dataset for Australian and Indian English called BESSTIE, and compare the performance for explainable sarcasm detection for them with FLUTE, a standard English dataset containing sarcasm explanations. Our approach utilising PMP when evaluated on two open-weight LLMs (GEMMA and LLAMA) achieves statistically significant performance improvement across all tasks and datasets when compared with four alternative prompting strategies. We also find that alternative techniques such as agentic prompting mitigate context-related failures by enabling external knowledge retrieval.

This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.\n  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.",

This has raised concerns about intellectual property protection and the generation of deceptive content. Recent studies, such as Glaze and Anti-DreamBooth, have proposed using adversarial noise to protect images from these attacks. However, recent purification-based methods, such as DiffPure and Noise Upscaling, have successfully attacked these latest defenses, showing the vulnerabilities of these methods. Moreover, present methods show limited transferability across models, making them less effective against unknown text-to-image models. To address these issues, we propose a novel anti-mimicry method, StyleGuard. We propose a novel style loss that optimizes the style-related features in the latent space to make it deviate from the original image, which improves model-agnostic transferability. Additionally, to enhance the perturbation's ability to bypass diffusion-based purification, we designed a novel upscale loss that involves ensemble purifiers and upscalers during training. Extensive experiments on the WikiArt and CelebA datasets demonstrate that StyleGuard outperforms existing methods in robustness against various transformations and purifications, effectively countering style mimicry in various models. Moreover, StyleGuard is effective on different style mimicry methods, including DreamBooth and Textual Inversion. The code is available at https://github.com/PolyLiYJ/StyleGuard.",

Building on this benchmark, we propose PosterAgent, a top-down, visual-in-the-loop multi-agent pipeline: the (a)Parser distills the paper into a structured asset library; the (b)Planner aligns text-visual pairs into a binary-tree layout that preserves reading order and spatial balance; and the (c)Painter-Commenter loop refines each panel by executing rendering code and using VLM feedback to eliminate overflow and ensure alignment.

We enhance image-to-video models with interactive capabilities through additional action conditioning and autoregressive framework, and reveal that compounding error is inherently irreducible in autoregressive video generation, while insufficient memory mechanism leads to incoherence of world models. We propose video retrieval augmented generation (VRAG) with explicit global state conditioning, which significantly reduces long-term compounding errors and increases spatiotemporal consistency of world models. In contrast, naive autoregressive generation with extended context windows and retrieval-augmented generation prove less effective for video generation, primarily due to the limited in-context learning capabilities of current video models.

A common approach involves collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via backpropagation. However, the need to fine-tune for each new scenario is often impractical for deployment on edge devices. To address this challenge, we introduce \\paper, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory prediction that enables adaptation without fine-tuning on the scenario-specific data at inference time without requiring weight updates. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public benchmarks.

However, such modern generative models suffer from expensive inference, inhibiting their use in numerous scientific applications like Boltzmann Generators (BGs) for molecular conformations that require fast likelihood evaluation. In this paper, we revisit classical normalizing flows in the context of BGs that offer efficient sampling and likelihoods, but whose training via maximum likelihood is often unstable and computationally challenging. We propose Regression Training of Normalizing Flows (RegFlow), a novel and scalable regression-based training objective that bypasses the numerical instability and computational challenge of conventional maximum likelihood training in favour of a simple $\\ell_2$-regression objective. Specifically, RegFlow maps prior samples under our flow to targets computed using optimal transport couplings or a pre-trained continuous normalizing flow (CNF). To enhance numerical stability, RegFlow employs effective regularization strategies such as a new forward-backward self-consistency loss that enjoys painless implementation. Empirically, we demonstrate that RegFlow unlocks a broader class of architectures that were previously intractable to train for BGs with maximum likelihood. We also show RegFlow exceeds the performance, computational cost, and stability of maximum likelihood training in equilibrium sampling in Cartesian coordinates of alanine dipeptide, tripeptide, and tetrapeptide, showcasing its potential in molecular systems.",

We identify that the limited improvement stems from distribution discrepancies between the specific post-trained generator and the general reward model. To address this, we propose a framework that incentivizes LLMs to self-verify their own answers. By unifying answer generation and verification within a single reinforcement learning (RL) process, we train models that can effectively assess the correctness of their own solutions. The trained model can further scale its performance at inference time by verifying its generations, without the need for external verifiers. We train our self-verification models based on Qwen2.5-Math-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, demonstrating their capabilities across varying reasoning context lengths. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that our models can not only improve post-training performance but also enable effective test-time scaling.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.03237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection.

However, bridging this success to real-world applications remains a challenge. In practice, human search behavior is rarely a one-shot action. Instead, it is often a multi-round process guided by clues in mind. That is, a mental image ranging from vague recollections to vivid mental representations of the target image. Motivated by this gap, we study the task of Mental Image Retrieval (MIR), which targets the realistic yet underexplored setting where users refine their search for a mentally envisioned image through multi-round interactions with an image search engine. Central to successful interactive retrieval is the capability of machines to provide users with clear, actionable feedback; however, existing methods rely on indirect or abstract verbal feedback, which can be ambiguous, misleading, or ineffective for users to refine the query. To overcome this, we propose GenIR, a generative multi-round retrieval paradigm leveraging diffusion-based image generation to explicitly reify the AI system's understanding at each round. These synthetic visual representations provide clear, interpretable feedback, enabling users to refine their queries intuitively and effectively. We further introduce a fully automated pipeline to generate a high-quality multi-round MIR dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that GenIR significantly outperforms existing interactive methods in the MIR scenario. This work establishes a new task with a dataset and an effective generative retrieval method, providing a foundation for future research in this direction",

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are widely recognized as the foundation model for such robotic deployment, their reliance on offline expert demonstrations critically limits their capacity for post-deployment refinement. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce Action Preference Optimization (APO), a method designed to refine VLA models by human-assisted preference alignment gathered through interaction with environments. This method begins with a human-robot collaboration framework for reliable failure correction and interaction trajectory collection through human intervention. However, directly leveraging these interaction trajectories for preference optimization is non-trivial due to the challenges of irreversible robotic actions and token distribution mismatch. To solve this, APO proposes an adaptive reweighting algorithm with binary desirability signals derived from interaction, empowering VLA models effectively suppress failure-prone actions while enhancing corrective action adaptation. Ultimately, APO equips VLA models with the crucial capability to learn from failure, paving the way for their iterative refinement and reliable deployment in dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in simulation and real-world scenarios prove superior generalization and robustness of our human-assisted framework across a variety of manipulation tasks. We believe this work could bring insights for efficient and stable optimization of VLA models through human-robot collaboration.

To allow these policies to safely interact with their environments, we need a failure detector that gives a timely alert such that the robot can stop, backtrack, or ask for help. However, existing failure detectors are trained and tested only on one or a few specific tasks, while generalist VLAs require the detector to generalize and detect failures also in unseen tasks and novel environments. In this paper, we introduce the multitask failure detection problem and propose SAFE, a failure detector for generalist robot policies such as VLAs. We analyze the VLA feature space and find that VLAs have sufficient high-level knowledge about task success and failure, which is generic across different tasks. Based on this insight, we design SAFE to learn from VLA internal features and predict a single scalar indicating the likelihood of task failure. SAFE is trained on both successful and failed rollouts and is evaluated on unseen tasks. SAFE is compatible with different policy architectures. We test it on OpenVLA, $\\pi_0$, and $\\pi_0$-FAST in both simulated and real-world environments extensively. We compare SAFE with diverse baselines and show that SAFE achieves state-of-the-art failure detection performance and the best trade-off between accuracy and detection time using conformal prediction.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.10173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in high-fidelity image synthesis and prompt-guided generative modeling. However, ensuring adequate diversity in generated samples of prompt-guided diffusion models remains a challenge, particularly when the prompts span a broad semantic spectrum and the diversity of generated data needs to be evaluated in a prompt-aware fashion across semantically similar prompts. Recent methods have introduced guidance via diversity measures to encourage more varied generations. In this work, we extend the diversity measure-based approaches by proposing the Scalable Prompt-Aware R\\'eny Kernel Entropy Diversity Guidance (SPARKE) method for prompt-aware diversity guidance. SPARKE utilizes conditional entropy for diversity guidance, which dynamically conditions diversity measurement on similar prompts and enables prompt-aware diversity control. While the entropy-based guidance approach enhances prompt-aware diversity, its reliance on the matrix-based entropy scores poses computational challenges in large-scale generation settings. To address this, we focus on the special case of Conditional latent RKE Score Guidance, reducing entropy computation and gradient-based optimization complexity from the $O(n^3)$ of general entropy measures to $O(n)$. The reduced computational complexity allows for diversity-guided sampling over potentially thousands of generation rounds on different prompts. We numerically test the SPARKE method on several text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating that the proposed method improves the prompt-aware diversity of the generated data without incurring significant computational costs.

However, their widespread deployment has also raised significant safety concerns. In particular, LLM-generated content can exhibit unsafe behaviors such as toxicity, bias, or misinformation, especially in adversarial contexts, which has attracted increasing attention from both academia and industry. Although numerous studies have attempted to evaluate these risks, a comprehensive and systematic survey on safety evaluation of LLMs is still lacking. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting a structured overview of recent advances in safety evaluation of LLMs. Specifically, we propose a four-dimensional taxonomy: (i) Why to evaluate, which explores the background of safety evaluation of LLMs, how they differ from general LLMs evaluation, and the significance of such evaluation; (ii) What to evaluate, which examines and categorizes existing safety evaluation tasks based on key capabilities, including dimensions such as toxicity, robustness, ethics, bias and fairness, truthfulness, and related aspects; (iii) Where to evaluate, which summarizes the evaluation metrics, datasets and benchmarks currently used in safety evaluations; (iv) How to evaluate, which reviews existing mainstream evaluation methods based on the roles of the evaluators and some evaluation frameworks that integrate the entire evaluation pipeline. Finally, we identify the challenges in safety evaluation of LLMs and propose promising research directions to promote further advancement in this field.

In this work, we address this gap by introducing a framework inspired by cognitive psychology and education. Specifically, we decompose general learning ability into three distinct, complementary dimensions: Learning from Instructor (acquiring knowledge via explicit guidance), Learning from Concept (internalizing abstract structures and generalizing to new contexts), and Learning from Experience (adapting through accumulated exploration and feedback). We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across the three learning dimensions and identify several insightful findings, such as (i) interaction improves learning; (ii) conceptual understanding is scale-emergent and benefits larger models; and (iii) LLMs are effective few-shot learners but not many-shot learners.

While current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at System 2 thinking, their inability to perform fast thinking leads to high computational overhead and latency. In this work, we enable LRMs to approximate human intelligence through dynamic thinking speed adjustment, optimizing accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Our approach addresses two key questions: (1) how to control thinking speed in LRMs, and (2) when to adjust it for optimal performance. For the first question, we identify the steering vector that governs slow-fast thinking transitions in LRMs' representation space. Using this vector, we achieve the first representation editing-based test-time scaling effect, outperforming existing prompt-based scaling methods. For the second question, we apply real-time difficulty estimation to signal reasoning segments of varying complexity. Combining these techniques, we propose the first reasoning strategy that enables fast processing of easy steps and deeper analysis for complex reasoning. Without any training or additional cost, our plug-in module delivers an average +1.3% accuracy with -8.6% token usage across leading LRMs and advanced reasoning benchmarks.

Recent alternatives, including warmup-stable-decay (WSD) schedules and weight averaging, offer greater flexibility. However, WSD relies on explicit decay phases to track progress, while weight averaging addresses this limitation at the cost of additional memory. In search of a more principled and scalable alternative, we revisit the Schedule-Free (SF) method [Defazio et al., 2024], which has shown strong empirical performance across diverse settings. We show that SF-AdamW effectively navigates the \"river\" structure of the loss landscape without decay phases or auxiliary averaging, making it particularly suitable for continuously scaling training workloads. To understand this behavior, we conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of SF dynamics, revealing that it implicitly performs weight averaging without memory overhead. Guided by this analysis, we propose a refined variant of SF that improves robustness to momentum and performs better under large batch sizes, addressing key limitations of the original method. Together, these results establish SF as a practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded approach for language model training.",

In this work, we start from the hypothesis that the domain in which VL training could have a significant effect is lexical-conceptual knowledge, in particular its taxonomic organization. Through comparing minimal pairs of text-only LMs and their VL-trained counterparts, we first show that the VL models often outperform their text-only counterparts on a text-only question-answering task that requires taxonomic understanding of concepts mentioned in the questions. Using an array of targeted behavioral and representational analyses, we show that the LMs and VLMs do not differ significantly in terms of their taxonomic knowledge itself, but they differ in how they represent questions that contain concepts in a taxonomic relation vs. a non-taxonomic relation. This implies that the taxonomic knowledge itself does not change substantially through additional VL training, but VL training does improve the deployment of this knowledge in the context of a specific task, even when the presentation of the task is purely linguistic.",

Although video generation models offer cost-efficient solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges, we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts (LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference. (2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of desired effects.",

Experiments demonstrate the potential of using KLD-based stability signals for dynamic adaptation. An algorithm guided by these signals achieves end-to-end latency competitive with leading baselines and exhibits superior robustness across diverse workloads.

Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval, followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity recognition, and text compression.

    "title": "RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback & Verifiable Rewards",
    "summary": "arXiv:2509.21319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.23885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this work proposes a novel method of TUnable-geneRalizatioN Diffusion (TurnDiff) powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction. Firstly, a contextual subdata self-enhancing similarity strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, TurnDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Comprehensive evaluation on both benchmark datasets and real-world data demonstrates that TurnDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction and generalization.",

Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints, enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image quality as measured by FID and SSIM.

This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200 prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in epistemic representation",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.08604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Jailbreaks are adversarial attacks designed to bypass the built-in safety mechanisms of large language models. Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.",

Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by 15% over individual-only baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.",

We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor).

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.17670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for further investigation.",

Developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity. For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods.

A less-explored but strategically rich structure is the bounded one-sided response, where a player's action briefly transfers control to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

However, prior work often overlooks the tight coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various system and data dynamics.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function. The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam. However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions, non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve convergence and accuracy.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.",

We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding. Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and guiding development toward more effective interactions.",

    "summary": "Recent video generation models can produce high-fidelity, temporally coherent videos, indicating that they may encode substantial world knowledge. Beyond realistic synthesis, they also exhibit emerging behaviors indicative of visual perception, modeling, and manipulation. Yet, an important question still remains: Are video models ready to serve as zero-shot reasoners in challenging visual reasoning scenarios? In this work, we conduct an empirical study to comprehensively investigate this question, focusing on the leading and popular Veo-3. We evaluate its reasoning behavior across 12 dimensions, including spatial, geometric, physical, temporal, and embodied logic, systematically characterizing both its strengths and failure modes. To standardize this study, we curate the evaluation data into MME-CoF, a compact benchmark that enables in-depth and thorough assessment of Chain-of-Frame (CoF) reasoning. Our findings reveal that while current video models demonstrate promising reasoning patterns on short-horizon spatial coherence, fine-grained grounding, and locally consistent dynamics, they remain limited in long-horizon causal reasoning, strict geometric constraints, and abstract logic. Overall, they are not yet reliable as standalone zero-shot reasoners, but exhibit encouraging signs as complementary visual engines alongside dedicated reasoning models.

Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures, and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception, generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic virtual world generation.",

    "summary": "Despite recent advances in 3D human motion generation (MoGen) on standard benchmarks, existing models still face a fundamental bottleneck in their generalization capability. In contrast, adjacent generative fields, most notably video generation (ViGen), have demonstrated remarkable generalization in modeling human behaviors, highlighting transferable insights that MoGen can leverage. Motivated by this observation, we present a comprehensive framework that systematically transfers knowledge from ViGen to MoGen across three key pillars: data, modeling, and evaluation. First, we introduce ViMoGen-228K, a large-scale dataset comprising 228,000 high-quality motion samples that integrates high-fidelity optical MoCap data with semantically annotated motions from web videos and synthesized samples generated by state-of-the-art ViGen models. The dataset includes both text-motion pairs and text-video-motion triplets, substantially expanding semantic diversity. Second, we propose ViMoGen, a flow-matching-based diffusion transformer that unifies priors from MoCap data and ViGen models through gated multimodal conditioning. To enhance efficiency, we further develop ViMoGen-light, a distilled variant that eliminates video generation dependencies while preserving strong generalization. Finally, we present MBench, a hierarchical benchmark designed for fine-grained evaluation across motion quality, prompt fidelity, and generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms existing approaches in both automatic and human evaluations. The code, data, and benchmark will be made publicly available.",

However, existing vision-language models (VLMs) still lack accurate perception of details and struggle to extract fine-grained structures from charts. Such limitations in chart grounding also hinder their ability to compare multiple charts and reason over them. In this paper, we introduce a novel \"ChartAlign Benchmark (ChartAB)\" to provide a comprehensive evaluation of VLMs in chart grounding tasks, i.e., extracting tabular data, localizing visualization elements, and recognizing various attributes from charts of diverse types and complexities. We design a JSON template to facilitate the calculation of evaluation metrics specifically tailored for each grounding task. By incorporating a novel two-stage inference workflow, the benchmark can further evaluate VLMs' capability to align and compare elements/attributes across two charts. Our analysis of evaluations on several recent VLMs reveals new insights into their perception biases, weaknesses, robustness, and hallucinations in chart understanding. These findings highlight the fine-grained discrepancies among VLMs in chart understanding tasks and point to specific skills that need to be strengthened in current models.",

    "summary": "We present AMO-Bench, an Advanced Mathematical reasoning benchmark with Olympiad level or even higher difficulty, comprising 50 human-crafted problems. Existing benchmarks have widely leveraged high school math competitions for evaluating mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, many existing math competitions are becoming less effective for assessing top-tier LLMs due to performance saturation (e.g., AIME24/25). To address this, AMO-Bench introduces more rigorous challenges by ensuring all 50 problems are (1) cross-validated by experts to meet at least the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) difficulty standards, and (2) entirely original problems to prevent potential performance leakages from data memorization. Moreover, each problem in AMO-Bench requires only a final answer rather than a proof, enabling automatic and robust grading for evaluation. Experimental results across 26 LLMs on AMO-Bench show that even the best-performing model achieves only 52.4% accuracy on AMO-Bench, with most LLMs scoring below 40%. Beyond these poor performances, our further analysis reveals a promising scaling trend with increasing test-time compute on AMO-Bench. These results highlight the significant room for improving the mathematical reasoning in current LLMs. We release AMO-Bench to facilitate further research into advancing the reasoning abilities of language models. https://amo-bench.github.io/",

    "summary": "The \"end-to-end\" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly \"end-to-end\" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight heads that, at each step, dynamically predict context-specific temperature and top-p values alongside the next-token logits. This approach transforms decoding into a parametric, token-level process, allowing the model to self-regulate its sampling strategy within a single forward pass.   Through extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, we demonstrate that AutoDeco not only significantly outperforms default decoding strategies but also achieves performance comparable to an oracle-tuned baseline derived from \"hacking the test set\"-a practical upper bound for any static method. Crucially, we uncover an emergent capability for instruction-based decoding control: the model learns to interpret natural language commands (e.g., \"generate with low randomness\") and adjusts its predicted temperature and top-p on a token-by-token basis, opening a new paradigm for steerable and interactive LLM decoding.",

    "summary": "We introduce Kimi Linear, a hybrid linear attention architecture that, for the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR) transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical delta rule.   We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output lengths.   To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model checkpoints.",

Specifically, we propose a thinking protocol where an organizer dynamically assigns sub-queries to workers, merges intermediate knowledge, and produces coherent solutions. More importantly, the thinking structure in this protocol can be further optimized through reinforcement learning.

    "summary": "Self-improvement has emerged as a mainstream paradigm for advancing the reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), where models explore and learn from successful trajectories iteratively. However, we identify a critical issue during this process: the model excels at generating high-quality trajectories for simple queries (i.e., head data) but struggles with more complex ones (i.e., tail data). This leads to an imbalanced optimization that drives the model to prioritize simple reasoning skills, while hindering its ability to tackle more complex reasoning tasks. Over iterations, this imbalance becomes increasingly pronounced--a dynamic we term the \"Matthew effect\"--which ultimately hinders further model improvement and leads to performance bottlenecks. To counteract this challenge, we introduce four efficient strategies from two perspectives: distribution-reshaping and trajectory-resampling, to achieve head-tail re-balancing during the exploration-and-learning self-improvement process. Extensive experiments on Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct and InternVL2.5-4B models across visual reasoning tasks demonstrate that our methods consistently improve visual reasoning capabilities, outperforming vanilla self-improvement by 3.86 points on average.",

It first derives the bounding box layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that implicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little geometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed full-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space, each part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution, enabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a center-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when exchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby maintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part data, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to date with 40K objects and 320K parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FullPart achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D part generation. We will release all code, data, and model to benefit future research in 3D part generation.",

    "title": "PORTool: Tool-Use LLM Training with Rewarded Tree",
    "summary": "Current tool-use large language models (LLMs) are trained on static datasets, enabling them to interact with external tools and perform multi-step, tool-integrated reasoning, which produces tool-call trajectories. However, these models imitate how a query is resolved in a generic tool-call routine, thereby failing to explore possible solutions and demonstrating limited performance in an evolved, dynamic tool-call environment. In this work, we propose PORTool, a reinforcement learning (RL) method that encourages a tool-use LLM to explore various trajectories yielding the correct answer. Specifically, this method starts with generating multiple rollouts for a given query, and some of them share the first few tool-call steps, thereby forming a tree-like structure. Next, we assign rewards to each step, based on its ability to produce a correct answer and make successful tool calls. A shared step across different trajectories receives the same reward, while different steps under the same fork receive different rewards. Finally, these step-wise rewards are used to calculate fork-relative advantages, blended with trajectory-relative advantages, to train the LLM for tool use. The experiments utilize 17 tools to address user queries, covering both time-sensitive and time-invariant topics. We conduct ablation studies to systematically justify the necessity and the design robustness of step-wise rewards. Furthermore, we compare the proposed PORTool with other training approaches and demonstrate significant improvements in final accuracy and the number of tool-call steps.",

    "title": "Supervised Reinforcement Learning: From Expert Trajectories to Step-wise Reasoning",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with problems that require multi-step reasoning. For small-scale open-source models, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) fails when correct solutions are rarely sampled even after many attempts, while Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tends to overfit long demonstrations through rigid token-by-token imitation. To address this gap, we propose Supervised Reinforcement Learning (SRL), a framework that reformulates problem solving as generating a sequence of logical \"actions\". SRL trains the model to generate an internal reasoning monologue before committing to each action. It provides smoother rewards based on the similarity between the model's actions and expert actions extracted from the SFT dataset in a step-wise manner. This supervision offers richer learning signals even when all rollouts are incorrect, while encouraging flexible reasoning guided by expert demonstrations. As a result, SRL enables small models to learn challenging problems previously unlearnable by SFT or RLVR. Moreover, initializing training with SRL before refining with RLVR yields the strongest overall performance. Beyond reasoning benchmarks, SRL generalizes effectively to agentic software engineering tasks, establishing it as a robust and versatile training framework for reasoning-oriented LLMs.",

    "summary": "Current text-to-image generative models are trained on large uncurated datasets to enable diverse generation capabilities. However, this does not align well with user preferences. Recently, reward models have been specifically designed to perform post-hoc selection of generated images and align them to a reward, typically user preference. This discarding of informative data together with the optimizing for a single reward tend to harm diversity, semantic fidelity and efficiency. Instead of this post-processing, we propose to condition the model on multiple reward models during training to let the model learn user preferences directly. We show that this not only dramatically improves the visual quality of the generated images but it also significantly speeds up the training. Our proposed method, called MIRO, achieves state-of-the-art performances on the GenEval compositional benchmark and user-preference scores (PickAScore, ImageReward, HPSv2).",

    "summary": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly capable of answering medical questions that require joint reasoning over images and text, yet training general medical VQA systems is impeded by the lack of large, openly usable, high-quality corpora. We present MedVLSynther, a rubric-guided generator-verifier framework that synthesizes high-quality multiple-choice VQA items directly from open biomedical literature by conditioning on figures, captions, and in-text references. The generator produces self-contained stems and parallel, mutually exclusive options under a machine-checkable JSON schema; a multi-stage verifier enforces essential gates (self-containment, single correct answer, clinical validity, image-text consistency), awards fine-grained positive points, and penalizes common failure modes before acceptance. Applying this pipeline to PubMed Central yields MedSynVQA: 13,087 audited questions over 14,803 images spanning 13 imaging modalities and 28 anatomical regions. Training open-weight LMMs with reinforcement learning using verifiable rewards improves accuracy across six medical VQA benchmarks, achieving averages of 55.85 (3B) and 58.15 (7B), with up to 77.57 on VQA-RAD and 67.76 on PathVQA, outperforming strong medical LMMs. A Ablations verify that both generation and verification are necessary and that more verified data consistently helps, and a targeted contamination analysis detects no leakage from evaluation suites. By operating entirely on open literature and open-weight models, MedVLSynther offers an auditable, reproducible, and privacy-preserving path to scalable medical VQA training data.",

    "title": "EHR-R1: A Reasoning-Enhanced Foundational Language Model for Electronic Health Record Analysis",
    "summary": "Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.",

We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.",

    "summary": "Designing enzyme backbones with substrate-specific functionality is a critical challenge in computational protein engineering. Current generative models excel in protein design but face limitations in binding data, substrate-specific control, and flexibility for de novo enzyme backbone generation. To address this, we introduce EnzyBind, a dataset with 11,100 experimentally validated enzyme-substrate pairs specifically curated from PDBbind. Building on this, we propose EnzyControl, a method that enables functional and substrate-specific control in enzyme backbone generation. Our approach generates enzyme backbones conditioned on MSA-annotated catalytic sites and their corresponding substrates, which are automatically extracted from curated enzyme-substrate data. At the core of EnzyControl is EnzyAdapter, a lightweight, modular component integrated into a pretrained motif-scaffolding model, allowing it to become substrate-aware. A two-stage training paradigm further refines the model's ability to generate accurate and functional enzyme structures. Experiments show that our EnzyControl achieves the best performance across structural and functional metrics on EnzyBind and EnzyBench benchmarks, with particularly notable improvements of 13\\% in designability and 13\\% in catalytic efficiency compared to the baseline models.

    "title": "Magentic Marketplace: An Open-Source Environment for Studying Agentic Markets",
    "summary": "As LLM agents advance, they are increasingly mediating economic decisions, ranging from product discovery to transactions, on behalf of users. Such applications promise benefits but also raise many questions about agent accountability and value for users. Addressing these questions requires understanding how agents behave in realistic market conditions. However, previous research has largely evaluated agents in constrained settings, such as single-task marketplaces (e.g., negotiation) or structured two-agent interactions. Real-world markets are fundamentally different: they require agents to handle diverse economic activities and coordinate within large, dynamic ecosystems where multiple agents with opaque behaviors may engage in open-ended dialogues. To bridge this gap, we investigate two-sided agentic marketplaces where Assistant agents represent consumers and Service agents represent competing businesses. To study these interactions safely, we develop Magentic-Marketplace-- a simulated environment where Assistants and Services can operate. This environment enables us to study key market dynamics: the utility agents achieve, behavioral biases, vulnerability to manipulation, and how search mechanisms shape market outcomes. Our experiments show that frontier models can approach optimal welfare-- but only under ideal search conditions. Performance degrades sharply with scale, and all models exhibit severe first-proposal bias, creating 10-30x advantages for response speed over quality. These findings reveal how behaviors emerge across market conditions, informing the design of fair and efficient agentic marketplaces.",

    "summary": "Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem. However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce CityRiSE, a novel framework for Reasoning urban Socio-Economic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines, improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators. This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.",

    "title": "Exploring Conditions for Diffusion models in Robotic Control",
    "summary": "While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains - yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific, dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA, which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.",
