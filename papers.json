    "title": "Scheduling Your LLM Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning Trees",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's `Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy. However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score (r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to 3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.",

Automating this coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care.

In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a systematic evaluation.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25014v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading (browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably, ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash) matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25101v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs) iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries, and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision, which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling. Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1 achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.",

Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder, Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF), and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable, and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety governance.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25205v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification, quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However, these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework, called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning. Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by 3.9% to 8.5%",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25206v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones. Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes problem-specific strategies in reasoning.",

However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort.

However, existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution, failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization.

On the Go Abstractions in Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework, which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.",

This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic: symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance). Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both adaptable and reliable.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25471v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete, goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and directing them toward human-aligned ends.",

    "title": "Zero Reinforcement Learning Towards General Domains",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25528v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains. Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25529v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration. The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning, leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across complex control tasks.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25588v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations, primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia, USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.",

The high autonomy, widespread adoption, and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different use cases with 230 different functionalities.

Existing approaches typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and efficient long-document understanding.",

However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.

However, most of previous approaches cannot handle large graphs efficiently, due to that (i) computation on graphs is often costly and (ii) the size of graph or the intermediate results of vectors could be prohibitively large, rendering it difficult to be processed on a single machine. In this paper, we propose an efficient and effective distributed algorithm for network embedding on large graphs using Apache Spark, which recursively partitions a graph into several small-sized subgraphs to capture the internal and external structural information of nodes, and then computes the network embedding for each subgraph in parallel. Finally, by aggregating the outputs on all subgraphs, we obtain the embeddings of nodes in a linear cost. After that, we demonstrate in various experiments that our proposed approach is able to handle graphs with billions of edges within a few hours and is at least 4 times faster than the state-of-the-art approaches. Besides, it achieves up to $4.25\\%$ and $4.27\\%$ improvements on link prediction and node classification tasks respectively. In the end, we deploy the proposed algorithms in two online games of Tencent with the applications of friend recommendation and item recommendation, which improve the competitors by up to $91.11\\%$ in running time and up to $12.80\\%$ in the corresponding evaluation metrics.",

Our neural models captured temporal gaze dynamics and fused them with trait and stimulus information, yielding consistent gains over SVM and literature baselines. Results show that (i) stimulus cues strongly enhance perceived-emotion predictions (macro F1 up to 0.77), while (ii) personality traits provide the largest improvements for felt emotion recognition (macro F1 up to 0.58).

This paper introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles: diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment. A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while maintaining epistemic modesty.",

It contains 600 Chinese questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields, ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys, expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries. Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects (abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.",

    "title": "Dual-Domain Deep Learning-Assisted NOMA-CSK Systems for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24763v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Ensuring secure and efficient multi-user (MU) transmission is critical for vehicular communication systems. Chaos-based modulation schemes have garnered considerable interest due to their benefits in physical layer security. However, most existing MU chaotic communication systems, particularly those based on non-coherent detection, suffer from low spectral efficiency due to reference signal transmission, and limited user connectivity under orthogonal multiple access (OMA). While non-orthogonal schemes, such as sparse code multiple access (SCMA)-based DCSK, have been explored, they face high computational complexity and inflexible scalability due to their fixed codebook designs. This paper proposes a deep learning-assisted power domain non-orthogonal multiple access chaos shift keying (DL-NOMA-CSK) system for vehicular communications. A deep neural network (DNN)-based demodulator is designed to learn intrinsic chaotic signal characteristics during offline training, thereby eliminating the need for chaotic synchronization or reference signal transmission. The demodulator employs a dual-domain feature extraction architecture that jointly processes the time-domain and frequency-domain information of chaotic signals, enhancing feature learning under dynamic channels. The DNN is integrated into the successive interference cancellation (SIC) framework to mitigate error propagation issues. Theoretical analysis and extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE), energy efficiency (EE), bit error rate (BER), security, and robustness, while maintaining lower computational complexity compared to traditional MU-DCSK and existing DL-aided schemes. These advantages validate its practical viability for secure vehicular communications.",

To determine whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4 model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors, interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management, among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving health outcomes.",

To circumvent the lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However, simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24770v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Tractography fiber clustering using diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a crucial method for white matter (WM) parcellation to enable analysis of brains structural connectivity in health and disease. Current fiber clustering strategies primarily use the fiber geometric characteristics (i.e., the spatial trajectories) to group similar fibers into clusters, while neglecting the functional and microstructural information of the fiber tracts. There is increasing evidence that neural activity in the WM can be measured using functional MRI (fMRI), providing potentially valuable multimodal information for fiber clustering to enhance its functional coherence. Furthermore, microstructural features such as fractional anisotropy (FA) can be computed from dMRI as additional information to ensure the anatomical coherence of the clusters. In this paper, we develop a novel deep learning fiber clustering framework, namely Deep Multi-view Fiber Clustering (DMVFC), which uses joint multi-modal dMRI and fMRI data to enable functionally consistent WM parcellation. DMVFC can effectively integrate the geometric and microstructural characteristics of the WM fibers with the fMRI BOLD signals along the fiber tracts. DMVFC includes two major components: (1) a multi-view pretraining module to compute embedding features from each source of information separately, including fiber geometry, microstructure measures, and functional signals, and (2) a collaborative fine-tuning module to simultaneously refine the differences of embeddings. In the experiments, we compare DMVFC with two state-of-the-art fiber clustering methods and demonstrate superior performance in achieving functionally meaningful and consistent WM parcellation results.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24772v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A simple linear probe decodes the internal \"solvability belief\" of a model, revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge - although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged, indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24777v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module (CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and modality-specific contributions.",

However, these models impose significant computational demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\\times$ latency reduction, and sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests, satisfying real-time VR requirements.

This benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding, particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and scale-invariant reasoning.

To better understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent, and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for further investigation.",

We present Fortytwo, a novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of +17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness. Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while retaining practical deployability.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24802v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Understanding and replicating human mobility requires not only spatial-temporal accuracy but also an awareness of the cognitive hierarchy underlying real-world travel decisions. Traditional agent-based or deep learning models can reproduce statistical patterns of movement but fail to capture the semantic coherence and causal logic of human behavior. Large language models (LLMs) show potential, but struggle to balance creative reasoning with strict structural compliance. This study proposes a Hierarchical LLM-Agent Framework, termed Narrative-to-Action, that integrates high-level narrative reasoning, mid-level reflective planning, and low-level behavioral execution within a unified cognitive hierarchy. At the macro level, one agent is employed as a \"creative writer\" to produce diary-style narratives rich in motivation and context, then uses another agent as a \"structural parser\" to convert narratives into machine-readable plans. A dynamic execution module further grounds agents in geographic environments and enables adaptive behavioral adjustments guided by a novel occupation-aware metric, Mobility Entropy by Occupation (MEO), which captures heterogeneous schedule flexibility across different occupational personalities. At the micro level, the agent executes concrete actions-selecting locations, transportation modes, and time intervals-through interaction with an environmental simulation. By embedding this multi-layer cognitive process, the framework produces not only synthetic trajectories that align closely with real-world patterns but also interpretable representations of human decision logic. This research advances synthetic mobility generation from a data-driven paradigm to a cognition-driven simulation, providing a scalable pathway for understanding, predicting, and synthesizing complex urban mobility behaviors through hierarchical LLM agents.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24803v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Practical deployment of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) demands strong test-time performance, motivating methods that guide inference-time search and selectively spend compute to improve quality. We present the Multi-Agent System Process Reward Model (MASPRM). It assigns per-action, per-agent values to partial inter-agent transcripts and acts as an inference-time controller. MASPRM is trained from multi-agent Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts without requiring step-level human annotations, by propagating returns to local targets. At inference, MASPRM guides step-level beam search and MCTS, focusing computation on promising branches and pruning early. On GSM8K and MATH, MASPRM-guided decoding with an outcome reward model (ORM) applied to the final answer, improves exact match (EM) over a single straight-through MAS pass by $+30.7$ and $+22.9$ points, respectively. A MASPRM trained on GSM8K transfers zero-shot to MATH without retraining, adding $8.4$ EM points at the same budget. MASPRM is a plug-in value model that estimates per-agent progress and complements verifier-style decoders, enabling more reliable, compute-aware multi-agent reasoning.

    "title": "CT-Less Attenuation Correction Using Multiview Ensemble Conditional Diffusion Model on High-Resolution Uncorrected PET Images",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24805v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Accurate quantification in positron emission tomography (PET) is essential for accurate diagnostic results and effective treatment tracking. A major issue encountered in PET imaging is attenuation. Attenuation refers to the diminution of photon detected as they traverse biological tissues before reaching detectors. When such corrections are absent or inadequate, this signal degradation can introduce inaccurate quantification, making it difficult to differentiate benign from malignant conditions, and can potentially lead to misdiagnosis. Typically, this correction is done with co-computed Computed Tomography (CT) imaging to obtain structural data for calculating photon attenuation across the body. However, this methodology subjects patients to extra ionizing radiation exposure, suffers from potential spatial misregistration between PET/CT imaging sequences, and demands costly equipment infrastructure. Emerging advances in neural network architectures present an alternative approach via synthetic CT image synthesis. Our investigation reveals that Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) can generate high quality CT images from non attenuation corrected PET images in order to correct attenuation. By utilizing all three orthogonal views from non-attenuation-corrected PET images, the DDPM approach combined with ensemble voting generates higher quality pseudo-CT images with reduced artifacts and improved slice-to-slice consistency. Results from a study of 159 head scans acquired with the Siemens Biograph Vision PET/CT scanner demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative improvements in pseudo-CT generation. The method achieved a mean absolute error of 32 $\\pm$ 10.4 HU on the CT images and an average error of (1.48 $\\pm$ 0.68)\\% across all regions of interest when comparing PET images reconstructed using the attenuation map of the generated pseudo-CT versus the true CT.",

An important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this. We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial for existing fact-checking systems.",

To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically, salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning approaches.",

However, traditional sensory evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction, challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%.

Therefore, we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs' perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring 9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and the alignment between video features and model capabilities.

Developing automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity. For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild, Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW, word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.",

While inference-time methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable safety-utility balance.",

While AI-assisted participants completed several tasks faster and more accurately, no significant pre-post differences emerged in standardized measures of problem solving or verbal comprehension.

While conceptual modeling languages like i* represent trust relationships qualitatively, they lack computational mechanisms for analyzing how trust changes with behavioral evidence. Conversely, computational trust models from multi-agent systems provide algorithmic updating but lack grounding in requirements engineering contexts and conceptual models. This technical report bridges this gap by developing a computational trust model that extends game-theoretic foundations for strategic coopetition with dynamic trust evolution. We introduce trust as a two-layer system with immediate trust responding to current behavior and reputation tracking violation history. Trust evolves through asymmetric updating where cooperation builds trust gradually while violations erode it sharply, creating hysteresis effects and trust ceilings that constrain relationship recovery. We develop a structured translation framework enabling requirements engineers to instantiate computational trust models from i* dependency networks and organizational contexts. Comprehensive experimental validation across 78,125 parameter configurations establishes robust emergence of negativity bias, hysteresis effects, and cumulative damage amplification. Empirical validation using the Renault-Nissan Alliance case study (1999-2025) achieves 49 out of 60 validation points (81.7%), successfully reproducing documented trust evolution across five distinct relationship phases including crisis and recovery periods.

We examine whether such neurons are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector - Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive neurons.

We then show that this low-rank structure can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated, or even nonsensical prompts.\n  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24976v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful architectures in medical image analysis, excelling in tasks such as disease detection, segmentation, and classification. However, their reliance on large, attention-driven models makes them vulnerable to hardware-level attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel threat model referred to as Med-Hammer that combines the Rowhammer hardware fault injection with neural Trojan attacks to compromise the integrity of ViT-based medical imaging systems. Specifically, we demonstrate how malicious bit flips induced via Rowhammer can trigger implanted neural Trojans, leading to targeted misclassification or suppression of critical diagnoses (e.g., tumors or lesions) in medical scans. Through extensive experiments on benchmark medical imaging datasets such as ISIC, Brain Tumor, and MedMNIST, we show that such attacks can remain stealthy while achieving high attack success rates about 82.51% and 92.56% in MobileViT and SwinTransformer, respectively. We further investigate how architectural properties, such as model sparsity, attention weight distribution, and the number of features of the layer, impact attack effectiveness. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored intersection between hardware-level faults and deep learning security in healthcare applications, underscoring the urgent need for robust defenses spanning both model architectures and underlying hardware platforms.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24980v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern. Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B, achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs, FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24983v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL) but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget. Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks, LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline RL.",

FaRAccel integrates reconfigurable logic for dynamic activation rerouting, and lightweight storage of rewiring configurations, enabling low-latency inference with minimal energy overhead. We evaluate FaRAccel across a suite of Transformer models and demonstrate substantial reductions in FaR inference latency and improvement in energy efficiency, while maintaining the robustness gains of the original FaR methodology.

Traditional approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26% prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.",

However, the complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis, and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution. Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar performance by composing information across layers through query-value interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.",

ALPR is vital in traffic control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and 91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model. Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process and overall model performance.

A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty, and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness. Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle, pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",

This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2) under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of implicit gaps inference, we introduce \\textbf{\\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps. This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions.

Typically, these games fall into three categories based on the flow of control: strictly-sequential (where players alternate single actions), deterministic-response (where some actions trigger a fixed outcome), and unbounded reciprocal-response (where alternating counterplays are permitted). A less-explored but strategically rich structure exists: the bounded one-sided response. This dynamic occurs when a player's action briefly transfers control to the opponent, who must satisfy a fixed condition through one or more sequential moves before the turn resolves. We term games featuring this mechanism Bounded One-Sided Response Games (BORGs).\n  We introduce a modified version of Monopoly Deal as a benchmark environment that specifically isolates the BORG dynamic, where a Rent action forces the opponent to sequentially choose payment assets. We demonstrate that the gold-standard algorithm, Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR), successfully converges on effective strategies for this domain without requiring novel algorithmic extensions. To support efficient, reproducible experimentation, we present a lightweight, full-stack research platform that unifies the environment, a parallelized CFR runtime, and a human-playable web interface, all runnable on a single workstation.

To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.",

Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach, including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative modeling.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25130v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle. Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness. Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the $l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into these influential activations tightens the $l_\\infty$ local Lipschitz constant and enhances certified robustness.",

Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that redefines how models interact with documents.\n  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for reasoning.\n  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25178v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Intra-sentence multilingual speech synthesis (code-switching TTS) remains a major challenge due to abrupt language shifts, varied scripts, and mismatched prosody between languages. Conventional TTS systems are typically monolingual and fail to produce natural, intelligible speech in mixed-language contexts. We introduce Script-First Multilingual Synthesis with Adaptive Locale Resolution (SFMS-ALR), an engine-agnostic framework for fluent, real-time code-switched speech generation. SFMS-ALR segments input text by Unicode script, applies adaptive language identification to determine each segment's language and locale, and normalizes prosody using sentiment-aware adjustments to preserve expressive continuity across languages. The algorithm generates a unified SSML representation with appropriate \"lang\" or \"voice\" spans and synthesizes the utterance in a single TTS request. Unlike end-to-end multilingual models, SFMS-ALR requires no retraining and integrates seamlessly with existing voices from Google, Apple, Amazon, and other providers. Comparative analysis with data-driven pipelines such as Unicom and Mask LID demonstrates SFMS-ALR's flexibility, interpretability, and immediate deployability. The framework establishes a modular baseline for high-quality, engine-independent multilingual TTS and outlines evaluation strategies for intelligibility, naturalness, and user preference.",

To this end, we propose Fed-PELAD, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates personalized encoders and a LoRA-adapted shared decoder. Specifically, personalized encoders are trained locally on each user equipment (UE) to capture device-specific channel characteristics, while a shared decoder is updated globally via the coordination of the base station (BS) by using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This design ensures that only compact LoRA adapter parameters instead of full model updates are transmitted for aggregation. To further enhance convergence stability, we introduce an alternating freezing strategy with calibrated learning-rate ratio during LoRA aggregation. Extensive simulations on 3GPP-standard channel models demonstrate that Fed-PELAD requires only 42.97\\% of the uplink communication cost compared to conventional methods while achieving a performance gain of 1.2 dB in CSI feedback accuracy under heterogeneous conditions.",

We define resilience across three layers: psychological, including emotion regulation, meaning-making, cognitive flexibility; social, including trust, social capital, coordinated response; organizational, including psychological safety, feedback mechanisms, and graceful degradation. We synthesize early evidence that these capacities buffer individual strain, reduce burnout through social support, and lower silent failure in AI-mediated workflows through team norms and risk-responsive governance. We also show that resilience can be cultivated through training that complements rather than substitutes for structural safeguards.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25220v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model. However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second, autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP), which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",

The installation employs SpecMaskGIT, a lightweight yet high-quality sound generation AI model, to generate and playback eight-channel sound in real-time, creating an immersive auditory experience over the course of a three-month exhibition. The work is grounded in the concept of a \"new form of archive,\" which aims to preserve the artistic style of an artist while expanding beyond artists' past artworks by continued generation of new sound elements. This speculative approach to archival preservation is facilitated by training the AI model on a dataset consisting of over 200 hours of Evala's past sound artworks.\n  By addressing key requirements in the co-creation of art using AI, this study highlights the value of the following aspects: (1) the necessity of integrating artist feedback, (2) datasets derived from an artist's past works, and (3) ensuring the inclusion of unexpected, novel outputs. In Studies for, the model was designed to reflect the artist's artistic identity while generating new, previously unheard sounds, making it a fitting realization of the concept of \"a new form of archive.\" We propose a Human-AI co-creation framework for effectively incorporating sound generation AI models into the sound art creation process and suggest new possibilities for creating and archiving sound art that extend an artist's work beyond their physical existence.

With the rapid advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences (Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without compromising lip-sync quality.",

The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons, which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy training via reinforcement learning.

We propose Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.

While transferring into hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA.

As a result, the learned policy can exploit one or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",

Unlike prior works focused on photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D) sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and (iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose 4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent geometry using differentiable B\\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion), which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes, enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing baselines in both fidelity and controllability.

In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding. Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units, allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based multimodal testbed.

The numerical methods to do this efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function. The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam. However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions, non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve convergence and accuracy.",

This success has motivated efforts to apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification, contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability. Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging human expertise with computational modeling.

While they have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25386v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms, facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible. The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception, logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation. We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.",

Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO) can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.",

To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak.

Conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E) transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems. The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter (CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native NextG.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25420v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for single-image restoration, but their application to zero-shot video restoration suffers from temporal inconsistencies due to the stochastic nature of sampling and complexity of incorporating explicit temporal modeling. In this work, we address the challenge of improving temporal coherence in video restoration using zero-shot image-based diffusion models without retraining or modifying their architecture. We propose two complementary inference-time strategies: (1) Perceptual Straightening Guidance (PSG) based on the neuroscience-inspired perceptual straightening hypothesis, which steers the diffusion denoising process towards smoother temporal evolution by incorporating a curvature penalty in a perceptual space to improve temporal perceptual scores, such as Fr\\'echet Video Distance (FVD) and perceptual straightness; and (2) Multi-Path Ensemble Sampling (MPES), which aims at reducing stochastic variation by ensembling multiple diffusion trajectories to improve fidelity (distortion) scores, such as PSNR and SSIM, without sacrificing sharpness. Together, these training-free techniques provide a practical path toward temporally stable high-fidelity perceptual video restoration using large pretrained diffusion models. We performed extensive experiments over multiple datasets and degradation types, systematically evaluating each strategy to understand their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while PSG enhances temporal naturalness, particularly in case of temporal blur, MPES consistently improves fidelity and spatio-temporal perception--distortion trade-off across all tasks.",

This study examines LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore, implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models. Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction more natural and contextually grounded.",

Current paradigms either myopically optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators, creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and deploying proactive dialogue agents \\textit{directly from offline expert data}, bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \\textbf{observed future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense, turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy, decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \\texttt{(action, state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \\textbf{what to ask} and, crucially, \\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of \\texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations, our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts, proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible, real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented LLM applications.",

One important step towards excelling in empirical research on LLMs and their application is to first understand to what extent current research results are eventually reproducible and what factors may impede reproducibility. This investigation is within the scope of our work.

To analyze the impact of such treatment switches within the low sample size limitations of rare disease trials, it is important to use all available data sources. This, however, is complicated when usage of measurement instruments change during the observation period, for example when instruments are adapted to specific age ranges. The resulting disjoint longitudinal data trajectories, complicate the application of traditional modeling approaches like mixed-effects regression. We tackle this by mapping observations of each instrument to a aligned low-dimensional temporal trajectory, enabling longitudinal modeling across instruments. Specifically, we employ a set of variational autoencoder architectures to embed item values into a shared latent space for each time point. Temporal disease dynamics and treatment switch effects are then captured through a mixed-effects regression model applied to latent representations. To enable statistical inference, we present a novel statistical testing approach that accounts for the joint parameter estimation of mixed-effects regression and variational autoencoders. The methodology is applied to quantify the impact of treatment switches for patients with spinal muscular atrophy. Here, our approach aligns motor performance items from different measurement instruments for mixed-effects regression and maps estimated effects back to the observed item level to quantify the treatment switch effect. Our approach allows for model selection as well as for assessing effects of treatment switching. The results highlight the potential of modeling in joint latent representations for addressing small data challenges.",

The hidden state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially large Hilbert space $\\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction, making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints. At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory, and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine translation.

This capability allows SFMs to be exposed to, and potentially respond to, rich paralinguistic variations embedded in the input speech signal. One under-explored dimension of paralinguistic variation is voice quality, encompassing phonation types such as creaky and breathy voice. These phonation types are known to influence how listeners infer affective state, stance and social meaning in speech. Existing benchmarks for speech understanding largely rely on multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) formats, which are prone to failure and therefore unreliable in capturing the nuanced ways paralinguistic features influence model behaviour. In this paper, we probe SFMs through open-ended generation tasks and speech emotion recognition, evaluating whether model behaviours are consistent across different phonation inputs. We introduce a new parallel dataset featuring synthesized modifications to voice quality, designed to evaluate SFM responses to creaky and breathy voice. Our work provides the first examination of SFM sensitivity to these particular non-lexical aspects of speech perception.",

    "title": "RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25590v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25595v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities. Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.25602v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI accelerators.",

Yet when these VLMs are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning, showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together, our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to recover inherited VL capabilities.

This issue is particularly critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex, multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries, progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable 97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%.

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.",

Our approach is built upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills as well as their continuous parameters.

Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here, we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset.

To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate modeling of dynamic structural problems.\n  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss, which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.\n  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful predictions.\n  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity.

To support this shift, we introduce collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility grows with increasing user involvement.

Using the conformal prediction framework, previous works construct sets of LLM responses where the probability of including an incorrect response, or error, is capped at a desired user-defined tolerance level. However, since these methods are based on p-values, they are susceptible to p-hacking, i.e., choosing the tolerance level post-hoc can invalidate the guarantees. We therefore leverage e-values to complement generative model outputs with e-scores as a measure of incorrectness. In addition to achieving the same statistical guarantees as before, e-scores provide users flexibility in adaptively choosing tolerance levels after observing the e-scores themselves, by upper bounding a post-hoc notion of error called size distortion.

We find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination -- continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation, evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.",

The majority of results in AI thus far have been achieved using deep neural networks trained with a learning algorithm called error backpropagation, always considered biologically implausible. To this end, recent works have studied learning algorithms for deep neural networks inspired by the neurosciences. One such theory, called predictive coding (PC), has shown promising properties that make it potentially valuable for the machine learning community: it can model information processing in different areas of the brain, can be used in control and robotics, has a solid mathematical foundation in variational inference, and performs its computations asynchronously. Inspired by such properties, works that propose novel PC-like algorithms are starting to be present in multiple sub-fields of machine learning and AI at large. Here, we survey such efforts by first providing a broad overview of the history of PC to provide common ground for the understanding of the recent developments, then by describing current efforts and results, and concluding with a large discussion of possible implications and ways forward.",

We propose a novel method for robustly and completely recalibrating values within these datasets to enhance LLMs' resilience against the issues. In particular, we devise a guaranteed polynomial time ranking algorithm that robustifies several existing models, such as the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry, 1952) model and certain generalizations of it. To the best of our knowledge, our present work is the first to propose an algorithm that provably recovers an $\\epsilon$-optimal ranking with high probability while allowing as large as $O(n)$ perturbed pairwise comparison results per model response. Furthermore, we show robust recovery results in the partially observed setting. Our experiments confirm that our algorithms handle adversarial noise and unobserved comparisons well in both general and LLM preference dataset settings. This work contributes to the development and scaling of more reliable and ethically aligned AI models by equipping the dataset curation pipeline with the ability to handle missing and maliciously manipulated inputs.",

In this work, we introduce a benchmark based on brainteasers written in long narrative form to probe more deeply into the types of reasoning strategies that models use. Brainteasers are well-suited for this goal because they can be solved with multiple approaches, such as a few-step solution that uses a creative insight or a longer solution that uses more brute force. We investigate large language models (LLMs) across multiple layers of reasoning, focusing not only on correctness but also on the quality and creativity of their solutions. We investigate many aspects of the reasoning process: (1) semantic parsing of the brainteasers into precise mathematical competition style formats; (2) generating solutions from these mathematical forms; (3) self-correcting solutions based on gold solutions; (4) producing step-by-step sketches of solutions; and (5) making use of hints. We find that LLMs are in many cases able to find creative, insightful solutions to brainteasers, suggesting that they capture some of the capacities needed to solve novel problems in creative ways. Nonetheless, there also remain situations where they rely on brute force despite the availability of more efficient, creative solutions, highlighting a potential direction for improvement in the reasoning abilities of LLMs.",

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a recent prominent method that encourages models to generate complete reasoning traces before answering, leading to increased token usage and computational cost. Inspired by the human-like thinking process-where people skip reasoning for easy questions but think carefully when needed-we explore how to enable VLMs to first decide when reasoning is necessary. To realize this, we propose TON, a two-stage training strategy: (i) a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage with a simple yet effective 'thought dropout' operation, where reasoning traces are randomly replaced with empty thoughts. This introduces a think-or-not format that serves as a cold start for selective reasoning; (ii) a GRPO stage that enables the model to freely explore when to think or not, while maximizing task-aware outcome rewards. Experimental results show that TON can reduce the completion length by up to 90% compared to vanilla GRPO, without sacrificing performance or even improving it. Further evaluations across LLM (GSM8K), VLM (CLEVR, Super-CLEVR, GeoQA), and Agentic (AITZ) tasks-covering a range of reasoning difficulties under both 3B and 7B models-consistently reveal that the model progressively learns to bypass unnecessary reasoning steps as training advances.

Leveraging the counterfactual effect size model and LLMs, we propose Agentic eXplanations via Interrogative Simulation (AXIS).

PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations.

However, citations generated directly by standalone LLMs are often unreliable. As a result, current systems insert citations by querying an external retriever at inference time, introducing latency, infrastructure dependence, and vulnerability to retrieval noise. We explore whether LLMs can be made to reliably attribute to the documents seen during continual pretraining without test-time retrieval, by revising the training process. To study this, we construct CitePretrainBench, a benchmark that mixes real-world corpora (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, arXiv) with novel documents and probes both short-form (single-fact) and long-form (multi-fact) citation tasks. Our approach follows a two-stage process: (1) continual pretraining to index factual knowledge by binding it to persistent document identifiers; and (2) instruction tuning to elicit citation behavior. We introduce Active Indexing for the first stage, which creates generalizable, source-anchored bindings by augmenting training with synthetic data that (i) restate each fact in diverse, compositional forms and (ii) enforce bidirectional training (source-to-fact and fact-to-source). This equips the model to both generate content from a cited source and attribute its own answers, improving robustness to paraphrase and composition. Experiments with Qwen-2.5-7B&3B show that Active Indexing consistently outperforms a Passive Indexing baseline, which simply appends an identifier to each document, achieving citation precision gains of up to 30.2% across all tasks and models. Our ablation studies reveal that performance continues to improve as we scale the amount of augmented data, showing a clear upward trend even at 16x the original token count.

The emergence of large language model (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing LLM-based drama generation methods often result in agents that lack initiative and cannot interact with the physical scene. Furthermore, these methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These limitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time performance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent framework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple topic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent improvisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given an autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based on their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to conversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of scene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon. The change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know and care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the quality of drama performance generated by HAMLET, we designed an evaluation method to assess three primary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and interaction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can create expressive and coherent theatrical experiences.",

Further, we use Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to show that the Deceptive instructions induce significant representational shifts compared to Truthful/Neutral representations (which are similar), concentrated in early-to-mid layers and detectable even on complex datasets. We also identify specific SAE features highly sensitive to deceptive instruction and use targeted visualizations to confirm distinct truthful/deceptive representational subspaces. % Our analysis pinpoints layer-wise and feature-level correlates of instructed dishonesty, offering insights for LLM detection and control.

Despite substantial progress in generating valid SQL, current LLMs still struggle with complex queries. To address this limitation, test-time strategies such as Best-of-N (BoN) and Majority Voting (Maj) are often employed, based on the assumption that LLMs can produce correct answers after multiple attempts. However, these methods rely on surface-level heuristics, selecting the syntactically correct query through execution-based BoN (ex-BoN) or the most frequently generated one through Majority Voting. Recently, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs), which assign utility scores to generated outputs based on semantic correctness, have emerged as a promising reinforcement learning approach for improving model alignment. We argue that ORMs could serve as an effective new test-time heuristic, although their application in this context remains largely underexplored.\n  In this work, we propose a unified framework for training ORMs tailored to the Text-to-SQL task and assess their effectiveness as a test-time heuristic within the BoN strategy. We benchmark ORMs against ex-BoN and Maj across the BIRD and Spider datasets, fine-tuning diverse open-source LLMs from the Qwen2, Granite3, and Llama3 families. Results show that ORMs outperform ex-BoN and Maj, achieving execution accuracy gains of +4.33% (BIRD) and +2.10% (Spider) over ex-BoN, and +2.91% (BIRD) and +0.93% (Spider) over Maj. We further demonstrate that finetuning models already aligned with SQL generation, such as OmniSQL, yields superior ORM performance. Additionally, we observe that ORMs achieve competitive results on simple queries and benefit more from an increased number of candidates compared to ex-BoN and Maj.",

This survey formalizes this conceptual shift by contrasting the degenerate single-step Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) of LLM-RL with the temporally extended, partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) that define Agentic RL. Building on this foundation, we propose a comprehensive twofold taxonomy: one organized around core agentic capabilities, including planning, tool use, memory, reasoning, self-improvement, and perception, and the other around their applications across diverse task domains. Central to our thesis is that reinforcement learning serves as the critical mechanism for transforming these capabilities from static, heuristic modules into adaptive, robust agentic behavior. To support and accelerate future research, we consolidate the landscape of open-source environments, benchmarks, and frameworks into a practical compendium.

At the same time, a growing body of research explores using LLMs to translate informal language into formal representations for reasoning, planning, and knowledge representation - often without explicitly referring to this process as autoformalization. As a result, despite addressing similar tasks, the largely independent development of these research areas has limited opportunities for shared methodologies, benchmarks, and theoretical frameworks that could accelerate progress. The goal of this paper is to review - explicit or implicit - instances of what can be considered autoformalization and to propose a unified framework, encouraging cross-pollination between different fields to advance the development of next generation AI systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2509.23234v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Obtaining high-quality outputs from Large Language Models (LLMs) often depends upon the choice of a sampling-based decoding strategy to probabilistically choose the next token at each generation step. While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/ryttry/p-less .",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.21285v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.",

They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G\\\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G\\\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications.

Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.",

Fitting a na\\\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data (say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular) estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.",

Purpose: To create a reproducible benchmarking resource leveraging the Duke Lung Cancer Screening (DLCS) and multiple public datasets to develop and evaluate models for nodule detection and classification. Materials & Methods: This retrospective study uses the DLCS dataset (1,613 patients; 2,487 nodules) and external datasets including LUNA16, LUNA25, and NLST-3D. For detection, MONAI RetinaNet models were trained on DLCS (DLCS-De) and LUNA16 (LUNA16-De) and evaluated using the Competition Performance Metric (CPM). For nodule-level classification, we compare five strategies: pretrained models (Models Genesis, Med3D), a self-supervised foundation model (FMCB), and ResNet50 with random initialization versus Strategic Warm-Start (ResNet50-SWS) pretrained with detection-derived candidate patches stratified by confidence. Results: For detection on the DLCS test set, DLCS-De achieved sensitivity 0.82 at 2 false positives/scan (CPM 0.63) versus LUNA16-De (0.62, CPM 0.45). For external validation on NLST-3D, DLCS-De (sensitivity 0.72, CPM 0.58) also outperformed LUNA16-De (sensitivity 0.64, CPM 0.49). For classification across multiple datasets, ResNet50-SWS attained AUCs of 0.71 (DLCS; 95% CI, 0.61-0.81), 0.90 (LUNA16; 0.87-0.93), 0.81 (NLST-3D; 0.79-0.82), and 0.80 (LUNA25; 0.78-0.82), matching or exceeding pretrained/self-supervised baselines. Performance differences reflected dataset label standards.

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods.

However, we observe two notable issues in existing metrics: 1) manually delaying the delivery of some tokens can improve SLOs, and 2) actively abandoning requests that do not meet SLOs can improve SLMs, both of which are counterintuitive.\n  In this paper, we revisit SLOs and SLMs in LLM serving, and propose a new SLO that aligns with user experience. Based on the SLO, we propose a comprehensive metric framework called smooth goodput, which integrates SLOs and SLMs to reflect the nature of user experience in LLM serving.

While parameter sharing (PS) is standard for efficient learning, it notoriously suppresses the behavioural diversity required for specialisation. This failure is largely due to cross-agent gradient interference, a problem we find is surprisingly exacerbated by the common practice of coupling agent IDs with observations. Existing remedies typically add complexity through altered objectives, manual preset diversity levels, or sequential updates -- raising a fundamental question: can shared policies adapt without these intricacies? We propose a solution built on a key insight: an agent-conditioned hypernetwork can generate agent-specific parameters and decouple observation- and agent-conditioned gradients, directly countering the interference from coupling agent IDs with observations. Our resulting method, HyperMARL, avoids the complexities of prior work and empirically reduces policy gradient variance. Across diverse MARL benchmarks (22 scenarios, up to 30 agents), HyperMARL achieves performance competitive with six key baselines while preserving behavioural diversity comparable to non-parameter sharing methods, establishing it as a versatile and principled approach for adaptive MARL.

This limitation arises from an inability to translate learned knowledge into predictions about physical behavior. Although continual fine-tuning can mitigate this issue, it is expensive for large models and impractical to perform repeatedly for every task. This necessitates the creation of modular and scalable ways to teach VLMs about physical reasoning. To that end, we introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), a modular framework where specialized smaller VLMs are fine-tuned to generate detailed physical scene descriptions. These can be used as physical contexts to enhance the reasoning capabilities of larger VLMs. PCBs enable the separation of visual perception from reasoning, allowing us to analyze their relative contributions to physical understanding. We perform experiments on CLEVRER and on Falling Tower, a stability detection dataset with both simulated and real-world scenes, to demonstrate that PCBs provide substantial performance improvements, increasing average accuracy by up to 13.8% on complex physical reasoning tasks. Notably, PCBs also show strong Sim2Real transfer, successfully generalizing from simulated training data to real-world scenes.",

By analyzing climate change discussions from Twitter and Reddit, we examine emotional transitions, intensity patterns, and semantic consistency between human-authored and LLM-generated content. Our findings reveal that while both models maintain high semantic coherence, they exhibit distinct emotional patterns: these models show a strong tendency to moderate negative emotions. When the input text carries negative emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, or sadness, LLM tends to generate content with more neutral emotions, or even convert them into positive emotions such as joy or surprise. At the same time, we compared the LLM-generated content with human-authored content. The four models systematically generated responses with reduced emotional intensity and showed a preference for neutral rational emotions in the response task. In addition, these models all maintained a high semantic similarity with the original text, although their performance in the continuation task and the response task was different. These findings provide deep insights into the emotion and semantic processing capabilities of LLM, which are of great significance for its deployment in social media environments and human-computer interaction design.",

Results reveal significant biases in protected attributes in all models, with differing preferences depending on model type and dilemma context. Notably, open-source LLMs show stronger preferences for marginalized groups and greater sensitivity in harmful scenarios, while closed-source models are more selective in protective situations and tend to favor mainstream groups. We also find that ethical behavior varies across dilemma types: LLMs maintain consistent patterns in protective scenarios but respond with more diverse and cognitively demanding decisions in harmful ones. Furthermore, models display more pronounced ethical tendencies under intersectional conditions than in single-attribute settings, suggesting that complex inputs reveal deeper biases. These findings highlight the need for multi-dimensional, context-aware evaluation of LLMs' ethical behavior and offer a systematic evaluation and approach to understanding and addressing fairness in LLM decision-making.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.04864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Credit assignmen, disentangling each agent's contribution to a shared reward, is a critical challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). To be effective, credit assignment methods must preserve the environment's optimal policy. Some recent approaches attempt this by enforcing return equivalence, where the sum of distributed rewards must equal the team reward. However, their guarantees are conditional on a learned model's regression accuracy, making them unreliable in practice. We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), an approach that decouples credit modeling from this constraint. A neural network learns unnormalized contribution scores, while a separate, deterministic normalization step enforces return equivalence by construction. We demonstrate that this method is equivalent to a valid Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS), which guarantees the optimal policy is preserved regardless of model accuracy. Empirically, on challenging SMACLite and Google Research Football (GRF) benchmarks, TAR$^2$ accelerates learning and achieves higher final performance than strong baselines. These results establish our method as an effective solution for the agent-temporal credit assignment problem.",

A key limitation lies in their reliance on the Markovian assumption, which restricts each step to condition only on the current state, leading to potential uncorrectable error accumulation. In this paper, we introduce CaDDi (Causal Discrete Diffusion Model), a discrete diffusion model that conditions on the entire generative trajectory, thereby lifting the Markov constraint and allowing the model to revisit and improve past states. By unifying sequential (causal) and temporal (diffusion) reasoning in a single non-Markovian transformer, CaDDi also treats standard causal language models as a special case and permits the direct reuse of pretrained LLM weights with no architectural changes. Empirically, CaDDi outperforms state-of-the-art discrete diffusion baselines on natural-language benchmarks, substantially narrowing the remaining gap to large autoregressive transformers.",

However, whereas latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns, entity conservation, and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), bridges the gap between: (1) keeping the traceability of individual entities in a latent system representation, and (2) leveraging the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder enable generative modeling directly in latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is the introduction of identifier representations (IDs) that enable the retrieval of entity properties and entity composition from latent system representations, thus fostering traceability.

We examine this question using economic games that simulate social dilemmas. First, we apply chain-of-thought and reflection prompting to GPT-4o in a Public Goods Game. We then evaluate multiple off-the-shelf models across six cooperation and punishment games, comparing those with and without explicit reasoning mechanisms. We find that reasoning models consistently reduce cooperation and norm enforcement, favoring individual rationality.

PhyE2E simplifies symbolic regression by decomposing it into sub-problems using the second-order derivatives of an oracle neural network, and employs a transformer model to translate data into symbolic formulas in an end-to-end manner. The resulting formulas are refined through Monte-Carlo Tree Search and Genetic Programming. We leverage a large language model to synthesize extensive symbolic expressions resembling real physics, and train the model to recover these formulas directly from data. A comprehensive evaluation reveals that PhyE2E outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, delivering superior symbolic accuracy, precision in data fitting, and consistency in physical units. We deployed PhyE2E to five applications in space physics, including the prediction of sunspot numbers, solar rotational angular velocity, emission line contribution functions, near-Earth plasma pressure, and lunar-tide plasma signals. The physical formulas generated by AI demonstrate a high degree of accuracy in fitting the experimental data from satellites and astronomical telescopes. We have successfully upgraded the formula proposed by NASA in 1993 regarding solar activity, and for the first time, provided the explanations for the long cycle of solar activity in an explicit form. We also found that the decay of near-Earth plasma pressure is proportional to r^2 to Earth, where subsequent mathematical derivations are consistent with satellite data from another independent study. Moreover, we found physical formulas that can describe the relationships between emission lines in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum of the Sun, temperatures, electron densities, and magnetic fields.

We postulate properties that arise naturally from our framework and find that the relationship between minimum flux among weights and density follows a power-law equation.

Mainstream approaches follow the learning-to-rank paradigm, which focus on discovering and modeling item topics (e.g., categories), and capturing user preferences on these topics based on historical interactions. However, this paradigm often neglects the modeling of user characteristics and their social roles, which are logical confounders influencing the correlated interest and user preference transition. To bridge this gap, we introduce the user role identification task and the behavioral logic modeling task that aim to explicitly model user roles and learn the logical relations between item topics and user social roles. We show that it is possible to explicitly solve these tasks through an efficient integration framework of Large Language Model (LLM) and recommendation systems, for which we propose TagCF. On the one hand, TagCF exploits the (Multi-modal) LLM's world knowledge and logic inference ability to extract realistic tag-based virtual logic graphs that reveal dynamic and expressive knowledge of users, refining our understanding of user behaviors. On the other hand, TagCF presents empirically effective integration modules that take advantage of the extracted tag-logic information, augmenting the recommendation performance. We conduct both online experiments and offline experiments with industrial and public datasets as verification of TagCF's effectiveness, and we empirically show that the user role modeling strategy is potentially a better choice than the modeling of item topics.

However, the decision-making process of GNNs remains opaque to the end user, which undermines their use in safety-critical applications. Several explainable AI techniques for graphs have been developed to address this major issue. Focusing on graph classification, these explainers identify subgraph motifs that explain predictions. Therefore, a robust benchmarking of graph explainers is required to ensure that the produced explanations are of high quality, i.e., aligned with the GNN's decision process. However, current graph-XAI benchmarks are limited to simplistic synthetic datasets or a few real-world tasks curated by domain experts, hindering rigorous and reproducible evaluation, and consequently stalling progress in the field. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method to automate the construction of graph XAI benchmarks from generic graph classification datasets. Our approach leverages the Weisfeiler-Leman color refinement algorithm to efficiently perform approximate subgraph matching and mine class-discriminating motifs, which serve as proxy ground-truth class explanations. At the same time, we ensure that these motifs can be learned by GNNs because their discriminating power aligns with WL expressiveness. This work also introduces the OpenGraphXAI benchmark suite, which consists of 15 ready-made graph-XAI datasets derived by applying our method to real-world molecular classification datasets. The suite is available to the public along with a codebase to generate over 2,000 additional graph-XAI benchmarks. Finally, we present a use case that illustrates how the suite can be used to assess the effectiveness of a selection of popular graph explainers, demonstrating the critical role of a sufficiently large benchmark collection for improving the significance of experimental results.",

This oversimplification fails to capture the complex, multidimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of continuous variations. We present a principled framework grounded in geometric and algebraic theories, showing that optimal model parameters across domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLio), which enables structure-preserving parameter transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To handle noisy or incomplete domain variation descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic forecasting, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both generalization accuracy and robustness.",

This optimizes for pass@1 performance and prioritizes the strength of isolated samples at the expense of the diversity and collective utility of sets of samples. This under-utilizes the sampling capacity, limiting exploration and eventual improvement on harder examples. As a fix, we propose Pass-at-k Policy Optimization (PKPO), a transformation on the final rewards which leads to direct optimization of pass@k performance, thus optimizing for sets of samples that maximize reward when considered jointly. Our contribution is to derive novel low variance unbiased estimators for pass@k and its gradient, in both the binary and continuous reward settings. We show optimization with our estimators reduces to standard RL with rewards that have been jointly transformed by a stable and efficient transformation function.\n  While previous efforts are restricted to k=n, ours is the first to enable robust optimization of pass@k for any arbitrary k <= n. Moreover, instead of trading off pass@1 performance for pass@k gains, our method allows annealing k during training, optimizing both metrics and often achieving strong pass@1 numbers alongside significant pass@k gains.\n  We validate our reward transformations on toy experiments, which reveal the variance reducing properties of our formulations. We also include real-world examples using the open-source LLM, GEMMA-2. We find that our transformation effectively optimizes for the target k. Furthermore, higher k values enable solving more and harder problems, while annealing k boosts both the pass@1 and pass@k . Crucially, for challenging task sets where conventional pass@1 optimization stalls, our pass@k approach unblocks learning, likely due to better exploration by prioritizing joint utility over the utility of individual samples.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.16368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLMs reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions.\n  We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.",

Current frontier model audits probe the cybersecurity risks of such agents, but most fail to account for the degrees of freedom available to adversaries in the real world. In particular, with strong verifiers and financial incentives, agents for offensive cybersecurity are amenable to iterative improvement by would-be adversaries. We argue that assessments should take into account an expanded threat model in the context of cybersecurity, emphasizing the varying degrees of freedom that an adversary may possess in stateful and non-stateful environments within a fixed compute budget. We show that even with a relatively small compute budget (8 H100 GPU Hours in our study), adversaries can improve an agent's cybersecurity capability on InterCode CTF by more than 40\\% relative to the baseline -- without any external assistance. These results highlight the need to evaluate agents' cybersecurity risk in a dynamic manner, painting a more representative picture of risk.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce InfoChartQA, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on infographic chart understanding. It includes 5,642 pairs of infographic and plain charts, each sharing the same underlying data but differing in visual presentations. We further design visual-element-based questions to capture their unique visual designs and communicative intent. Evaluation of 20 MLLMs reveals a substantial performance decline on infographic charts, particularly for visual-element-based questions related to metaphors.

Motivated by recent progress in learning-augmented algorithms, we study online bipartite fractional matching when the algorithm is given advice in the form of a suggested matching in each iteration. We develop algorithms for both the vertex-weighted and unweighted variants that provably dominate the naive \"coin flip\" strategy of randomly choosing between the advice-following and advice-free algorithms. Moreover, our algorithm for the vertex-weighted setting extends to the AdWords problem under the small bids assumption, yielding a significant improvement over the seminal work of Mahdian, Nazerzadeh, and Saberi (EC 2007, TALG 2012). Complementing our positive results, we establish a hardness bound on the robustness-consistency tradeoff that is attainable by any algorithm.

It enables the knowledge of models to be fused, without the need for heavy computation as required in traditional multitask learning. Existing merging methods often assume that entries at identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa, encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B. Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.

However, real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as signal anomalies, noise, and distributional shifts. Existing solutions primarily enhance robustness by modifying network architectures or training procedures. Nevertheless, these approaches are computationally intensive and resource-demanding, especially for large-scale applications. In this paper, we explore a novel test-time computing paradigm, namely learning with calibration, ST-TTC, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through learning with calibration, we aim to capture periodic structural biases arising from non-stationarity during the testing phase and perform real-time bias correction on predictions to improve accuracy. Specifically, we first introduce a spectral-domain calibrator with phase-amplitude modulation to mitigate periodic shift and then propose a flash updating mechanism with a streaming memory queue for efficient test-time computation. ST-TTC effectively bypasses complex training-stage techniques, offering an efficient and generalizable paradigm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, universality, flexibility and efficiency of our proposed method.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.03595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The recent success of Shampoo in the AlgoPerf contest has sparked renewed interest in Kronecker-factorization-based optimization algorithms for training neural networks. Despite its success, Shampoo relies heavily on several heuristics such as learning rate grafting and stale preconditioning to achieve performance at-scale. These heuristics increase algorithmic complexity, necessitate further hyperparameter tuning, and lack theoretical justification. This paper investigates these heuristics from the angle of Frobenius norm approximation to full-matrix Adam and decouples the preconditioner's eigenvalues and eigenbasis updates. We show that grafting from Adam mitigates the staleness and mis-scaling of the preconditioner's eigenvalues and how correcting the eigenvalues directly eliminates the need for learning rate grafting. To manage the error induced by infrequent eigenbasis computations, we propose an adaptive criterion for determining the eigenbasis computation frequency motivated by terminating a warm-started QR algorithm. This criterion decouples the update frequency of different preconditioner matrices and enables us to investigate the impact of approximation error on convergence. These practical techniques offer a principled angle towards removing Shampoo's heuristics and developing improved Kronecker-factorization-based training algorithms.",

However, the effectiveness of GRPO in Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) has still been less studyed. In this paper, we explore GRPO and identify two problems that deteriorate the effective learning: (1) reliance on safeguards, and (2) vanishing advantage. To mitigate these challenges, we propose DeepVideo-R1, a video large language model trained with Reg-GRPO (Regressive GRPO) and difficulty-aware data augmentation. Reg-GRPO reformulates the GRPO loss function into a regression task that directly predicts the advantage in GRPO, eliminating the need for safeguards such as the clipping and min functions. It directly aligns the model with advantages, providing guidance to prefer better ones.

Furthermore, a key use case of reasoning LMs is to act as teachers for distilling new students and cold-starting future RL iterations rather than being deployed themselves. From these considerations, we introduce a new framework that avoids RL's exploration challenge by training a new class of Reinforcement-Learned Teachers (RLTs) focused on yielding the most effective downstream distillation. RLTs are prompted with both the question and solution to each problem, and tasked to simply \"connect-the-dots\" with detailed explanations tailored for their students. We train RLTs with dense rewards obtained by feeding each explanation to the student and testing its understanding of the problem's solution. In practice, the raw outputs of a 7B RLT provide higher final performance on competition and graduate-level tasks than existing distillation and cold-starting pipelines that collect and postprocess the reasoning traces of orders of magnitude larger LMs. Furthermore, RLTs maintain their effectiveness when training larger students and when applied zero-shot to out-of-distribution tasks, unlocking new levels of efficiency and re-usability for the RL reasoning framework.

Our results highlight the influence of validation method and ensembling of hyperparameter configurations to benchmark models at their full potential. While gradient-boosted trees are still strong contenders on practical tabular datasets, we observe that deep learning methods have caught up under larger time budgets with ensembling. At the same time, foundation models excel on smaller datasets. Finally, we show that ensembles across models advance the state-of-the-art in tabular machine learning.

As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to understand how LLMs function when collaborating compared to operating as individual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a Utilitarian Boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that inflict harm but maximize benefits for the greatest number of people. We study whether a similar dynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We test six models on well-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where models reason independently, and (2) Group, where they engage in multi-turn discussions in pairs or triads. In personal dilemmas, where agents decide whether to directly harm an individual for the benefit of others, all models rated moral violations as more acceptable when part of a group, demonstrating a Utilitarian Boost similar to that observed in humans. However, the mechanism for the Boost in LLMs differed: While humans in groups become more utilitarian due to heightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups showed either reduced sensitivity to norms or enhanced impartiality. We report model differences in when and how strongly the Boost manifests. We also discuss prompt and agent compositions that enhance or mitigate the effect. We end with a discussion of the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent design, and artificial moral reasoning. Code available at: https://github.com/baltaci-r/MoralAgents",

Inspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework that extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar spectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical information about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral datasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support diverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves pre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed by contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different instruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve spectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between spectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information between embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework enabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We demonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets improves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and chemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and precision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data. Additionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities offer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively trained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance precision stellar spectroscopy.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.06204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based models.

To address this, we constructed a dynamic Probabilistic Boolean Network model using transcriptomic data from patient tumor biopsies to elucidate the regulatory logic governing therapy response. We then employed a reinforcement learning agent to systematically discover optimal, multi-step therapeutic interventions and used explainable artificial intelligence to mechanistically interpret the agent's control policy. The analysis revealed that a precisely timed, 4-step temporary inhibition of the lysyl oxidase like 2 protein (LOXL2) was the most effective strategy. Our explainable analysis showed that this ''hit-and-run\" intervention is sufficient to erase the molecular signature driving resistance, allowing the network to self-correct without requiring sustained intervention. This study presents a novel, time-dependent therapeutic hypothesis for overcoming immunotherapy resistance and provides a powerful computational framework for identifying non-obvious intervention protocols in complex biological systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.10530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Elucidating reaction mechanisms hinges on efficiently generating transition states (TSs), products, and complete reaction networks. Recent generative models, such as diffusion models for TS sampling and sequence-based architectures for product generation, offer faster alternatives to quantum-chemistry searches. But diffusion models remain constrained by their stochastic differential equation (SDE) dynamics, which suffer from inefficiency and limited controllability. We show that flow matching, a deterministic ordinary differential (ODE) formulation, can replace SDE-based diffusion for molecular and reaction generation. We introduce MolGEN, a conditional flow-matching framework that learns an optimal transport path to transport Gaussian priors to target chemical distributions. On benchmarks used by TSDiff and OA-ReactDiff, MolGEN surpasses TS geometry accuracy and barrier-height prediction while reducing sampling to sub-second inference. MolGEN also supports open-ended product generation with competitive top-k accuracy and avoids mass/electron-balance violations common to sequence models. In a realistic test on the $\\gamma$-ketohydroperoxide decomposition network, MolGEN yields higher fractions of valid and intended TSs with markedly fewer quantum-chemistry evaluations than string-based baselines. These results demonstrate that deterministic flow matching provides a unified, accurate, and computationally efficient foundation for molecular generative modeling, signaling that flow matching is the future for molecular generation across chemistry.",

We expose a fundamental flaw in this approach by introducing Adversarial PhoneTic Prompting (APT), a novel attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting phonetic memorization. The APT attack replaces iconic lyrics with homophonic but semantically unrelated alternatives (e.g., \"mom's spaghetti\" becomes \"Bob's confetti\"), preserving acoustic structure while altering meaning; we identify high-fidelity phonetic matches using CMU pronouncing dictionary. We demonstrate that leading Lyrics-to-Song (L2S) models like SUNO and YuE regenerate songs with striking melodic and rhythmic similarity to their copyrighted originals when prompted with these altered lyrics. More surprisingly, this vulnerability extends across modalities. When prompted with phonetically modified lyrics from a song, a Text-to-Video (T2V) model like Veo 3 reconstructs visual scenes from the original music video-including specific settings and character archetypes-despite the absence of any visual cues in the prompt. Our findings reveal that models memorize deep, structural patterns tied to acoustics, not just verbatim text. This phonetic-to-visual leakage represents a critical vulnerability in transcript-conditioned generative models, rendering simple copyright filters ineffective and raising urgent concerns about the secure deployment of multimodal AI systems.

    "summary": "arXiv:2507.22664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The presence of autonomous systems is growing at a fast pace and it is impacting many aspects of our lives. Designed to learn and act independently, these systems operate and perform decision-making without human intervention. However, they lack the ability to incorporate users' ethical preferences, which are unique for each individual in society and are required to personalize the decision-making processes. This reduces user trust and prevents autonomous systems from behaving according to the moral beliefs of their end-users. When multiple systems interact with differing ethical preferences, they must negotiate to reach an agreement that satisfies the ethical beliefs of all the parties involved and adjust their behavior consequently. To address this challenge, this paper proposes RobEthiChor, an approach that enables autonomous systems to incorporate user ethical preferences and contextual factors into their decision-making through ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor features a domain-agnostic reference architecture for designing autonomous systems capable of ethic-based negotiating. The paper also presents RobEthiChor-Ros, an implementation of RobEthiChor within the Robot Operating System (ROS), which can be deployed on robots to provide them with ethics-based negotiation capabilities. To evaluate our approach, we deployed RobEthiChor-Ros on real robots and ran scenarios where a pair of robots negotiate upon resource contention. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the system in realizing ethics-based negotiation. RobEthiChor allowed robots to reach an agreement in more than 73% of the scenarios with an acceptable negotiation time (0.67s on average). Experiments also demonstrate that the negotiation approach implemented in RobEthiChor is scalable.",

Current AI evaluation methodologies, which mainly focus on performance and accuracy, are insufficient to address these multifaceted issues. Thus, this study emphasizes the need for new human_centered criteria that also reflect social impact. To this end, it identifies key dimensions for evaluating the ethics and trustworthiness of generative AI_fairness, transparency, accountability, safety, privacy, accuracy, consistency, robustness, explainability, copyright and intellectual property protection, and source traceability and develops detailed indicators and assessment methodologies for each. Moreover, it provides a comparative analysis of AI ethics policies and guidelines in South Korea, the United States, the European Union, and China, deriving key approaches and implications from each. The proposed framework applies across the AI lifecycle and integrates technical assessments with multidisciplinary perspectives, thereby offering practical means to identify and manage ethical risks in real_world contexts.

While recent advances leverage powerful visual backbones and large language models, most approaches mainly focus on manual signals (hand gestures) and tend to overlook non-manual cues like mouthing. In fact, mouthing conveys essential linguistic information in sign languages and plays a crucial role in disambiguating visually similar signs. In this paper, we propose SignClip, a novel framework to improve the accuracy of sign language translation. It fuses manual and non-manual cues, specifically spatial gesture and lip movement features. Besides, SignClip introduces a hierarchical contrastive learning framework with multi-level alignment objectives, ensuring semantic consistency across sign-lip and visual-text modalities. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign, demonstrate the superiority of our approach. For example, on PHOENIX14T, in the Gloss-free setting, SignClip surpasses the previous state-of-the-art model SpaMo, improving BLEU-4 from 24.32 to 24.71, and ROUGE from 46.57 to 48.38.",

The approach utilizes a Deep Neural Network (DNN) with rich, engineered features from the large-scale ASSISTments educational dataset. A rigorous comparative analysis of federated aggregation strategies was conducted, identifying FedProx as a significantly more stable and effective method for handling heterogeneous student data than the standard FedAvg baseline. The optimized federated model achieves a high-performance F1-Score of 76.28%, corresponding to 92% of the performance of a powerful, centralized XGBoost model. These findings validate that a federated approach can provide highly effective content recommendations without centralizing sensitive student data.

This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\\`a-vis baseline models, i.e., FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.

However, existing mathematical noise generative models only capture part of the characteristics of noise. In this study, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) called noise generation GAN (NGGAN) that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data synthesis. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise over the NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. To train NGGAN, we adhere to the following principles: 1) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclostationary noise generation; 2) the Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and training data; and 3) to measure the similarity performances of GAN-based models based on the mathematical and practically measured datasets, we conduct both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include: 1) a piecewise spectral cyclostationary Gaussian model (PSCGM); 2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter; and 3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the generated noise samples from the proposed NGGAN are highly close to the real noise samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) scatter plots and Fr\\'echet inception distance (FID) analysis have shown that NGGAN outperforms other GAN-based models by generating noise samples with superior fidelity and higher diversity.",

ConsistencyAI tests whether, when users of different demographics ask identical questions, the model responds with factually inconsistent answers. Designed without involvement from LLM providers, this benchmark offers impartial evaluation and accountability. In our experiment, we queried 19 LLMs with prompts that requested 5 facts for each of 15 topics. We repeated this query 100 times for each LLM, each time adding prompt context from a different persona selected from a subset of personas modeling the general population. We processed the responses into sentence embeddings, computed cross-persona cosine similarity, and computed the weighted average of cross-persona cosine similarity to calculate factual consistency scores. In 100-persona experiments, scores ranged from 0.9065 to 0.7896, and the mean was 0.8656, which we adopt as a benchmark threshold. xAI's Grok-3 is most consistent, while several lightweight models rank lowest. Consistency varies by topic: the job market is least consistent, G7 world leaders most consistent, and issues like vaccines or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict diverge by provider.

    "title": "What Causes Postoperative Aspiration?",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.21779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs, significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration, enabling timely preventative interventions.\n  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\\% male) who experienced aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects (ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.\n  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\\% sensitivity on a held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/- 0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\\% higher maximum daily opioid dosages compared to women.\n  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk, enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation. These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.21797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The heterogeneity of multimodal data leads to inconsistencies and imbalance, allowing a dominant modality to steer gradient updates. Existing solutions mainly focus on optimization- or data-based strategies but rarely exploit the information inherent in multimodal imbalance or conduct its quantitative analysis. To address this gap, we propose a novel quantitative analysis framework for Multimodal Imbalance and design a sample-level adaptive loss function. We define the Modality Gap as the Softmax score difference between modalities for the correct class and model its distribution using a bimodal Gaussian Mixture Model(GMM), representing balanced and imbalanced samples. Using Bayes' theorem, we estimate each sample's posterior probability of belonging to these two groups. Based on this, our adaptive loss (1) minimizes the overall Modality Gap, (2) aligns imbalanced samples with balanced ones, and (3) adaptively penalizes each according to its imbalance degree. A two-stage training strategy-warm-up and adaptive phases,yields state-of-the-art performance on CREMA-D (80.65%), AVE (70.40%), and KineticSound (72.42%). Fine-tuning with high-quality samples identified by the GMM further improves results, highlighting their value for effective multimodal fusion.",

In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+. TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs are not always the optimal initialization point.

Current methods suffer from two fundamental limitations: the scarcity of full-band RIR datasets and the inability of existing models to generate acoustically accurate responses from diverse input modalities. We present PromptReverb, a two-stage generative framework that addresses these challenges. Our approach combines a variational autoencoder that upsamples band-limited RIRs to full-band quality (48 kHz), and a conditional diffusion transformer model based on rectified flow matching that generates RIRs from descriptions in natural language. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that PromptReverb produces RIRs with superior perceptual quality and acoustic accuracy compared to existing methods, achieving 8.8% mean RT60 error compared to -37% for widely used baselines and yielding more realistic room-acoustic parameters. Our method enables practical applications in virtual reality, architectural acoustics, and audio production where flexible, high-quality RIR synthesis is essential.",

Existing evaluation methods for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this, we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets, multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in finance-specific language models such as FinBERT have enabled the quantification of public sentiment into index-based measures, yet compressing diverse linguistic signals into single metrics overlooks contextual nuances and limits interpretability. To address this limitation, explainable AI techniques, particularly SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations), have been employed to identify influential features. However, SHAP's computational cost grows exponentially with input features, making it impractical for large-scale text-based financial data. This study introduces a GRU-based forecasting framework enhanced with GroupSHAP, which quantifies contributions of semantically related keyword groups rather than individual tokens, substantially reducing computational burden while preserving interpretability. We employed FinBERT to embed news articles from 2015 to 2024, clustered them into coherent semantic groups, and applied GroupSHAP to measure each group's contribution to stock price movements. The resulting group-level SHAP variables across multiple topics were used as input features for the prediction model. Empirical results from one-day-ahead forecasting of the S&P 500 index throughout 2024 demonstrate that our approach achieves a 32.2% reduction in MAE and a 40.5% reduction in RMSE compared with benchmark models without the GroupSHAP mechanism. This research presents the first application of GroupSHAP in news-driven financial forecasting, showing that grouped sentiment representations simultaneously enhance interpretability and predictive performance.",

Predicting how AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems. Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence, Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35 parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors. Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task characteristics.

In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.",

To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators.

Prevailing methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task, enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain effects.

Through this work, we study how data filtering and contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination -- continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity. Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods, especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior.

For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604 tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%.

We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly. We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples, forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines.

    "title": "RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing",
    "summary": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image, while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions, we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas. For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation, we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache. Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.",

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains: Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law, International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science, and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are publicly available to support open research.",

    "title": "SeeingEye: Agentic Information Flow Unlocks Multimodal Reasoning In Text-only LLMs",
    "summary": "Recent advances in text-only large language models (LLMs), such as DeepSeek-R1, demonstrate remarkable reasoning ability. However, these models remain fragile or entirely incapable when extended to multi-modal tasks. Existing approaches largely rely on single-form captions, which lack diversity and often fail to adapt across different types of Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks. As a result, they provide no principled or efficient channel for transmitting fine-grained visual information. We introduce Seeing Eye, a modular framework that unlocks multimodal reasoning in text-only LLMs through an agent-based small VLM translator. This translator acts as a perception agent: it can invoke specialized tools (e.g., OCR and crop) and iteratively distill multimodal inputs into structured intermediate representations (SIRs) tailored to the question. These SIRs are then passed to the text-only LLM, which serves as a reasoning agent. Crucially, the translator and reasoner engage in multi-round feedback and interaction, enabling the extraction of targeted visual details and yielding more confident answers. Experiments on knowledge-intensive VQA benchmarks, including MMMU and MIA-Bench, demonstrate that Seeing Eye not only reduces inference cost but also surpasses much larger end-to-end VLMs. For example, an instantiation combining a 3B-parameter vision translator with an 8B-parameter language reasoner outperforms a monolithic 32B VLM on challenging knowledge-based questions. Our results highlight that decoupling perception from reasoning via agent information flow offers a scalable and plug-and-play pathway to multimodal reasoning, allowing strong text-only LLMs to fully leverage their reasoning capabilities.

    "summary": "Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv\\\"ard's Impossible Staircase.

Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.",

    "summary": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.",

    "title": "Parallel Loop Transformer for Efficient Test-Time Computation Scaling",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or \"loops.\" However, this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop. This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques. First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache) from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.",

    "title": "MC-SJD : Maximal Coupling Speculative Jacobi Decoding for Autoregressive Visual Generation Acceleration",
    "summary": "While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD, a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations, all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR decoding, without any degradation in output quality.",

We present Fortytwo, a novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of +17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness. Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while retaining practical deployability.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM) with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors. Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the token budget.",

    "title": "The Principles of Diffusion Models",
    "summary": "This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data. Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers, and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning knowledge.",

    "title": "Rethinking Driving World Model as Synthetic Data Generator for Perception Tasks",
    "summary": "Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are really crucial for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks. Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally, the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

    "title": "Reasoning Language Model Inference Serving Unveiled: An Empirical Study",
    "summary": "The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1) significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference serving.",

    "title": "ChronoPlay: A Framework for Modeling Dual Dynamics and Authenticity in Game RAG Benchmarks",
    "summary": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly vital in dynamic domains like online gaming, yet the lack of a dedicated benchmark has impeded standardized evaluation in this area. The core difficulty lies in Dual Dynamics: the constant interplay between game content updates and the shifting focus of the player community. Furthermore, the necessity of automating such a benchmark introduces a critical requirement for player-centric authenticity to ensure generated questions are realistic. To address this integrated challenge, we introduce ChronoPlay, a novel framework for the automated and continuous generation of game RAG benchmarks. ChronoPlay utilizes a dual-dynamic update mechanism to track both forms of change, and a dual-source synthesis engine that draws from official sources and player community to ensure both factual correctness and authentic query patterns. We instantiate our framework on three distinct games to create the first dynamic RAG benchmark for the gaming domain, offering new insights into model performance under these complex and realistic conditions. Code is avaliable at: https://github.com/hly1998/ChronoPlay.",
