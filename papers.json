ProVideLLM integrates a multimodal cache configured to store two types of tokens - verbalized text tokens, which provide compressed textual summaries of long-term observations, and visual tokens, encoded with DETR-QFormer to capture fine-grained details from short-term observations. This design reduces token count by 22x over existing methods in representing one hour of long-term observations while effectively encoding fine-granularity of the present. By interleaving these tokens in our multimodal cache, ProVideLLM ensures sub-linear scaling of memory and compute with video length, enabling per-frame streaming inference at 10 FPS and streaming dialogue at 25 FPS, with a minimal 2GB GPU memory footprint. ProVideLLM also sets new state-of-the-art results on six procedural tasks across four datasets.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.13987v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) -- the most widely adopted guidance technique -- contrasts conditional and unconditional predictions to improve the generated images. This results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency, improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance mechanism based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. ERG results in significant improvements in various generation tasks such as text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further boosting generation performance.",

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a promising alternative, encoding both geometric and photorealistic properties within the weights of a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). This work investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of ingesting NeRFs into an MLLM. We introduce LLaNA, the first MLLM able to perform new tasks such as NeRF captioning and Q\\&A, by directly processing the weights of a NeRF's MLP. Notably, LLaNA is able to extract information about the represented objects without the need to render images or materialize 3D data structures. In addition, we build the first large-scale NeRF-language dataset, composed by more than 300K NeRFs trained on ShapeNet and Objaverse, with paired textual annotations that enable various NeRF-language tasks. Based on this dataset, we develop a benchmark to evaluate the NeRF understanding capability of our method. Results show that directly processing NeRF weights leads to better performance on NeRF-Language tasks compared to approaches that rely on either 2D or 3D representations derived from NeRFs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14011v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, the fashion industry has increasingly adopted AI technologies to enhance customer experience, driven by the proliferation of e-commerce platforms and virtual applications. Among the various tasks, virtual try-on and multimodal fashion image editing -- which utilizes diverse input modalities such as text, garment sketches, and body poses -- have become a key area of research. Diffusion models have emerged as a leading approach for such generative tasks, offering superior image quality and diversity. However, most existing virtual try-on methods rely on having a specific garment input, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios where users may only provide textual specifications. To address this limitation, in this work we introduce Fashion Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Fashion-RAG), a novel method that enables the customization of fashion items based on user preferences provided in textual form. Our approach retrieves multiple garments that match the input specifications and generates a personalized image by incorporating attributes from the retrieved items. To achieve this, we employ textual inversion techniques, where retrieved garment images are projected into the textual embedding space of the Stable Diffusion text encoder, allowing seamless integration of retrieved elements into the generative process. Experimental results on the Dress Code dataset demonstrate that Fashion-RAG outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, effectively capturing fine-grained visual details from retrieved garments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a retrieval-augmented generation approach specifically tailored for multimodal fashion image editing.",

In this work, we identify two critical factors for enhancing feature upsampling: the upsampler architecture and the training objective. For the upsampler architecture, we introduce a coordinate-based cross-attention transformer that integrates the high-resolution images with coordinates and low-resolution VFM features to generate sharp, high-quality features. For the training objective, we propose constructing high-resolution pseudo-groundtruth features by leveraging class-agnostic masks and self-distillation.

To enable 3D analysis, one usually integrates absolute monocular depth estimation with instance segmentation. However, monocular depth is a difficult task. Instead, we leverage a simpler single-image task, occlusion-based relative depth ordering, providing coarser but useful 3D information. We show that relative depth ordering works more reliably from occlusions than from absolute depth. We propose to solve the joint task of relative depth ordering and segmentation of instances based on occlusions. We call this task Occlusion-Ordered Semantic Instance Segmentation (OOSIS). We develop an approach to OOSIS that extracts instances and their occlusion order simultaneously from oriented occlusion boundaries and semantic segmentation. Unlike popular detect-and-segment framework for instance segmentation, combining occlusion ordering with instance segmentation allows a simple and clean formulation of OOSIS as a labeling problem. As a part of our solution for OOSIS, we develop a novel oriented occlusion boundaries approach that significantly outperforms prior work. We also develop a new joint OOSIS metric based both on instance mask accuracy and correctness of their occlusion order. We achieve better performance than strong baselines on KINS and COCOA datasets.",

Nonetheless, the intrinsic ill-posedness of LLIE and the difficulty in retrieving robust semantics from heavily corrupted images hinder their effectiveness in extremely low-light environments. To tackle this challenge, we present SG-LLIE, a new multi-scale CNN-Transformer hybrid framework guided by structure priors. Different from employing pre-trained models for the extraction of semantics or illumination maps, we choose to extract robust structure priors based on illumination-invariant edge detectors. Moreover, we develop a CNN-Transformer Hybrid Structure-Guided Feature Extractor (HSGFE) module at each scale with in the UNet encoder-decoder architecture. Besides the CNN blocks which excels in multi-scale feature extraction and fusion, we introduce a Structure-Guided Transformer Block (SGTB) in each HSGFE that incorporates structural priors to modulate the enhancement process.

To address these limitations, we introduce VideoPASTA (Preference Alignment with Spatio-Temporal-Cross Frame Adversaries), a framework that enhances Video-LLMs through targeted preference optimization. VideoPASTA trains models to distinguish accurate video representations from carefully generated adversarial examples that deliberately violate spatial, temporal, or cross-frame relations. By applying Direct Preference Optimization to just 7,020 preference pairs, VideoPASTA learns robust representations that capture fine-grained spatial relationships and long-range temporal dynamics. Experiments on standard video benchmarks show significant relative performance gains of 3.05% on VideoMME, 1.97% on NeXTQA, and 1.31% on LongVideoBench, over the baseline Qwen2.5-VL model. These results demonstrate that targeted alignment, rather than massive pretraining or architectural modifications, effectively addresses core video-language challenges. Notably, VideoPASTA achieves these improvements without human annotation or captioning, relying on just 32-frame sampling, compared to the 96-frame, multi-GPU setups of prior work. This efficiency makes our approach a scalable, plug-and-play solution that seamlessly integrates with existing models while preserving their capabilities.",

    "title": "Lightweight Road Environment Segmentation using Vector Quantization",
    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14113v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Road environment segmentation plays a significant role in autonomous driving. Numerous works based on Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) and Transformer architectures have been proposed to leverage local and global contextual learning for efficient and accurate semantic segmentation. In both architectures, the encoder often relies heavily on extracting continuous representations from the image, which limits the ability to represent meaningful discrete information. To address this limitation, we propose segmentation of the autonomous driving environment using vector quantization. Vector quantization offers three primary advantages for road environment segmentation. (1) Each continuous feature from the encoder is mapped to a discrete vector from the codebook, helping the model discover distinct features more easily than with complex continuous features. (2) Since a discrete feature acts as compressed versions of the encoder's continuous features, they also compress noise or outliers, enhancing the image segmentation task. (3) Vector quantization encourages the latent space to form coarse clusters of continuous features, forcing the model to group similar features, making the learned representations more structured for the decoding process. In this work, we combined vector quantization with the lightweight image segmentation model MobileUNETR and used it as a baseline model for comparison to demonstrate its efficiency. Through experiments, we achieved 77.0 % mIoU on Cityscapes, outperforming the baseline by 2.9 % without increasing the model's initial size or complexity.",

However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen generators in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-modal guided multi-perspective representation learning (BMRL) framework for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA), which facilitates effective traceability to unseen generators. Specifically, we design a multi-perspective visual encoder (MPVE) to explore general deepfake attribution visual characteristics across three views (i.e., image, noise, and edge). We devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via vision-parsing matching. A language encoder is proposed to capture fine-grained language embeddings, facilitating language-guided general visual forgery representation learning through vision-language alignment. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center (DFACC) loss, to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA task through various protocols evaluation.",

This study proposes an end-to-end deep learning approach using a modified version of U-Net and a custom loss function to directly obtain chemical maps from hyperspectral images, skipping all intermediate steps required for traditional pixel-wise analysis. We compare the U-Net with the traditional PLS regression on a real dataset of pork belly samples with associated mean fat reference values. The U-Net obtains a test set root mean squared error of between 9% and 13% lower than that of PLS regression on the task of mean fat prediction. At the same time, U-Net generates fine detail chemical maps where 99.91% of the variance is spatially correlated. Conversely, only 2.53% of the variance in the PLS-generated chemical maps is spatially correlated, indicating that each pixel-wise prediction is largely independent of neighboring pixels. Additionally, while the PLS-generated chemical maps contain predictions far beyond the physically possible range of 0-100%, U-Net learns to stay inside this range. Thus, the findings of this study indicate that U-Net is superior to PLS for chemical map generation.",

Existing generative approaches for multi-target attacks mainly analyze the effect of the use of target labels on noise generation from a theoretical perspective, lacking practical validation and comprehensive summarization. To address this gap, we first identify and validate that the semantic feature quality and quantity are critical factors affecting the transferability of targeted attacks: 1) Feature quality refers to the structural and detailed completeness of the implanted target features, as deficiencies may result in the loss of key discriminative information; 2) Feature quantity refers to the spatial sufficiency of the implanted target features, as inadequacy limits the victim model's attention to this feature. Based on these findings, we propose the 2D Tensor-Guided Adversarial Fusion (2D-TGAF) framework, which leverages the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models to encode target labels into two-dimensional semantic tensors for guiding adversarial noise generation. Additionally, we design a novel masking strategy tailored for the training process, ensuring that parts of the generated noise retain complete semantic information about the target class. Extensive experiments on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that 2D-TGAF consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods in attack success rates, both on normally trained models and across various defense mechanisms.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14200v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to adapt to new tasks without parameter updates, using a few demonstrations from a large support set. However, selecting informative demonstrations leads to high computational and memory costs. While some methods explore selecting a small and representative coreset in the text classification, evaluating all support set samples remains costly, and discarded samples lead to unnecessary information loss. These methods may also be less effective for image classification due to differences in feature spaces. Given these limitations, we propose Key-based Coreset Optimization (KeCO), a novel framework that leverages untapped data to construct a compact and informative coreset. We introduce visual features as keys within the coreset, which serve as the anchor for identifying samples to be updated through different selection strategies. By leveraging untapped samples from the support set, we update the keys of selected coreset samples, enabling the randomly initialized coreset to evolve into a more informative coreset under low computational cost. Through extensive experiments on coarse-grained and fine-grained image classification benchmarks, we demonstrate that KeCO effectively enhances ICL performance for image classification task, achieving an average improvement of more than 20\\%. Notably, we evaluate KeCO under a simulated online scenario, and the strong performance in this scenario highlights the practical value of our framework for resource-constrained real-world scenarios.",

Our method treats identity and text as a unified conditioning input. To achieve this, we introduce FaceCLIP, a multi-modal encoder that learns a joint embedding space for both identity and textual semantics. Given a reference face and a text prompt, FaceCLIP produces a unified representation that encodes both identity and text, which conditions a base diffusion model to generate images that are identity-consistent and text-aligned. We also present a multi-modal alignment algorithm to train FaceCLIP, using a loss that aligns its joint representation with face, text, and image embedding spaces. We then build FaceCLIP-SDXL, an ID-preserving image synthesis pipeline by integrating FaceCLIP with Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL).

Real-IAD D3 features finer defects, diverse anomalies, and greater scale across 20 categories, providing a challenging benchmark for multimodal IAD Additionally, we introduce an effective approach that integrates RGB, point cloud, and pseudo-3D depth information to leverage the complementary strengths of each modality, enhancing detection performance.

To address these issues, we propose CLIPXpert, a novel SF-OSDA approach that integrates two key components: an adaptive thresholding strategy and an unknown class feature filtering module. Specifically, the Box-Cox GMM-Based Adaptive Thresholding (BGAT) module dynamically determines the optimal threshold by estimating sample score distributions, balancing known class recognition and unknown class sample detection. Additionally, the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)-Based Unknown-Class Feature Filtering (SUFF) module reduces the tendency of unknown class samples towards known classes, improving the separation between known and unknown classes. Experiments show that our source-free and training-free method outperforms state-of-the-art trained approach UOTA by 1.92% on the DomainNet dataset, achieves SOTA-comparable performance on datasets such as Office-Home, and surpasses other SF-OSDA methods.

Our method consumes paired 2D-3D (image and point cloud) data and relies on the robust (cross-domain) features from a VFM to train a 3D backbone on a mix of labeled source and unlabeled target data. At the heart of our method lies a fusion network that is guided by both the image and point cloud streams, with their relative contributions adjusted based on the target domain.

To tackle these challenges, we present DocHR14K, a large-scale real-world dataset comprising 14,902 high-resolution image pairs across six document categories and various lighting conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first high-resolution dataset for document highlight removal that captures a wide range of real-world lighting conditions. Additionally, motivated by the observation that the residual map between highlighted and clean images naturally reveals the spatial structure of highlight regions, we propose a simple yet effective Highlight Location Prior (HLP) to estimate highlight masks without human annotations. Building on this prior, we present the Location-Aware Laplacian Pyramid Highlight Removal Network (L2HRNet), which effectively removes highlights by leveraging estimated priors and incorporates diffusion module to restore details.

However, its substantial volume poses significant challenges in storage and transmission. In order to obtain a high compression ratio, crucial semantic details usually confront severe damage, leading to difficulties in guaranteeing the accuracy of downstream tasks. To tackle this problem, we are the first to introduce a novel Region of Interest (ROI)-guided Point Cloud Geometry Compression (RPCGC) method for human and machine vision. Our framework employs a dual-branch parallel structure, where the base layer encodes and decodes a simplified version of the point cloud, and the enhancement layer refines this by focusing on geometry details. Furthermore, the residual information of the enhancement layer undergoes refinement through an ROI prediction network. This network generates mask information, which is then incorporated into the residuals, serving as a strong supervision signal. Additionally, we intricately apply these mask details in the Rate-Distortion (RD) optimization process, with each point weighted in the distortion calculation. Our loss function includes RD loss and detection loss to better guide point cloud encoding for the machine. Experiment results demonstrate that RPCGC achieves exceptional compression performance and better detection accuracy (10% gain) than some learning-based compression methods at high bitrates in ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets.",

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\\% in parameters and 85\\% in FLOPs.

However, the issue of biometric information leakage can still pose a serious threat to user privacy and anonymity. Currently, there is no cancelable biometric template generation scheme specifically designed for vein biometrics. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative cancelable vein biometric generation scheme: ColorVein. Unlike previous cancelable template generation schemes, ColorVein does not destroy the original biometric features and introduces additional color information to grayscale vein images. This method significantly enhances the information density of vein images by transforming static grayscale information into dynamically controllable color representations through interactive colorization. ColorVein allows users/administrators to define a controllable pseudo-random color space for grayscale vein images by editing the position, number, and color of hint points, thereby generating protected cancelable templates. Additionally, we propose a new secure center loss to optimize the training process of the protected feature extraction model, effectively increasing the feature distance between enrolled users and any potential impostors. Finally, we evaluate ColorVein's performance on all types of vein biometrics, including recognition performance, unlinkability, irreversibility, and revocability, and conduct security and privacy analyses.

Although they yield certain benefits, they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction, but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model, which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task, addressing two key limitations. It introduces, for the first time, a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely, the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts, thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models, achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

With the flourishing of multimodal learning, researchers started to explore multimodal video saliency prediction, including audio-visual and text-visual approaches. Auditory cues guide the gaze of viewers to sound sources, while textual cues provide semantic guidance for understanding video content. Integrating these complementary cues can improve the accuracy of saliency prediction. Therefore, we attempt to simultaneously analyze visual, auditory, and textual modalities in this paper, and propose TAVDiff, a Text-Audio-Visual-conditioned Diffusion Model for video saliency prediction. TAVDiff treats video saliency prediction as an image generation task conditioned on textual, audio, and visual inputs, and predicts saliency maps through stepwise denoising. To effectively utilize text, a large multimodal model is used to generate textual descriptions for video frames and introduce a saliency-oriented image-text response (SITR) mechanism to generate image-text response maps. It is used as conditional information to guide the model to localize the visual regions that are semantically related to the textual description. Regarding the auditory modality, it is used as another conditional information for directing the model to focus on salient regions indicated by sounds. At the same time, since the diffusion transformer (DiT) directly concatenates the conditional information with the timestep, which may affect the estimation of the noise level. To achieve effective conditional guidance, we propose Saliency-DiT, which decouples the conditional information from the timestep.

Additionally, diffusion models typically rely on global learned distributions rather than localized features, leading to inconsistencies between the generated and existing image parts. In this work, we propose ConFill, a novel framework that introduces a Context-Adaptive Discrepancy (CAD) model to ensure that intermediate distributions of known and unknown regions are closely aligned throughout the diffusion process. By incorporating CAD, our model progressively reduces discrepancies between generated and original images at each diffusion step, leading to contextually aligned completion. Moreover, ConFill uses a new Dynamic Sampling mechanism that adaptively increases the sampling rate in regions with high reconstruction complexity. This approach enables precise adjustments, enhancing detail and integration in restored areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConFill outperforms current methods, setting a new benchmark in image completion.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14301v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The rapid development of video surveillance systems for object detection, tracking, activity recognition, and anomaly detection has revolutionized our day-to-day lives while setting alarms for privacy concerns. It isn't easy to strike a balance between visual privacy and action recognition performance in most computer vision models. Is it possible to safeguard privacy without sacrificing performance? It poses a formidable challenge, as even minor privacy enhancements can lead to substantial performance degradation. To address this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving image anonymization technique that optimizes the anonymizer using penalties from the utility branch, ensuring improved action recognition performance while minimally affecting privacy leakage. This approach addresses the trade-off between minimizing privacy leakage and maintaining high action performance. The proposed approach is primarily designed to align with the regulatory standards of the EU AI Act and GDPR, ensuring the protection of personally identifiable information while maintaining action performance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a feature-based penalty scheme that exclusively controls the action features, allowing freedom to anonymize private attributes. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that applying a penalty to anonymizer from utility branch enhances action performance while maintaining nearly consistent privacy leakage across different penalty settings.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14306v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: As an essential procedure in earth observation system, change detection (CD) aims to reveal the spatial-temporal evolution of the observation regions. A key prerequisite for existing change detection algorithms is aligned geo-references between multi-temporal images by fine-grained registration. However, in the majority of real-world scenarios, a prior manual registration is required between the original images, which significantly increases the complexity of the CD workflow. In this paper, we proposed a self-supervision motivated CD framework with geometric estimation, called \"MatchCD\". Specifically, the proposed MatchCD framework utilizes the zero-shot capability to optimize the encoder with self-supervised contrastive representation, which is reused in the downstream image registration and change detection to simultaneously handle the bi-temporal unalignment and object change issues. Moreover, unlike the conventional change detection requiring segmenting the full-frame image into small patches, our MatchCD framework can directly process the original large-scale image (e.g., 6K*4K resolutions) with promising performance. The performance in multiple complex scenarios with significant geometric distortion demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed framework.",

As a result, trackers are often affected by interference from visually similar objects and are susceptible to tracking drift. To address these challenges, we propose a novel saliency-guided Siamese network tracker based on key fine-grained feature infor-mation. First, we introduce a fine-grained feature parallel learning convolu-tional block with a dual-stream architecture and convolutional kernels of varying sizes. This design captures essential global features from shallow layers, enhances feature diversity, and minimizes the loss of fine-grained in-formation typically encountered in residual connections. In addition, we propose a multi-layer fine-grained feature fusion module that uses bilinear matrix multiplication to effectively integrate features across both deep and shallow layers. Next, we introduce a Siamese residual refinement block that corrects saliency map prediction errors using residual learning. Combined with deep supervision, this mechanism progressively refines predictions, ap-plying supervision at each recursive step to ensure consistent improvements in accuracy. Finally, we present a saliency loss function to constrain the sali-ency predictions, directing the network to focus on highly discriminative fi-ne-grained features. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the pro-posed tracker achieves the highest precision and success rates on the PTB-TIR and LSOTB-TIR benchmarks.

To achieve this, prior methods employ DDIM inversion to transform source frames into latent noise, which is then fed into a pre-trained diffusion model, conditioned on the user-edited first frame, to generate the edited video. However, the DDIM inversion process accumulates errors, which hinder the latent noise from accurately reconstructing the source frames, ultimately compromising content consistency in the generated edited frames. To overcome it, our method eliminates the need for DDIM inversion by performing OCVE through a novel perspective based on visual prompting. Furthermore, inspired by consistency models that can perform multi-step consistency sampling to generate a sequence of content-consistent images, we propose a content consistency sampling (CCS) to ensure content consistency between the generated edited frames and the source frames. Moreover, we introduce a temporal-content consistency sampling (TCS) based on Stein Variational Gradient Descent to ensure temporal consistency across the edited frames.

This study addresses these gaps by conducting a comprehensive benchmark of machine learning and deep learning methods for tree species classification. For the study, we collected high-density multispectral ALS data (>1000 pts/m$^2$) at three wavelengths using the FGI-developed HeliALS system, complemented by existing Optech Titan data (35 pts/m$^2$), to evaluate the species classification accuracy of various algorithms in a test site located in Southern Finland. Based on 5261 test segments, our findings demonstrate that point-based deep learning methods, particularly a point transformer model, outperformed traditional machine learning and image-based deep learning approaches on high-density multispectral point clouds. For the high-density ALS dataset, a point transformer model provided the best performance reaching an overall (macro-average) accuracy of 87.9% (74.5%) with a training set of 1065 segments and 92.0% (85.1%) with 5000 training segments.

To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach consists of two key components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to infer the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing injection attacks, achieving at least a +26.4% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks.

In this work, we address this challenge and outline a data-efficient framework to instill multilingual VLMs with greater understanding of perceptual diversity. We specifically propose an LLM-based, multimodal recaptioning strategy that alters the object descriptions of English captions before translation. The greatest benefits are demonstrated in a targeted multimodal mechanism guided by native speaker data. By adding produced rewrites as augmentations in training, we improve on German and Japanese text-image retrieval cases studies (up to +3.5 mean recall overall, +4.7 on non-native error cases).

In this work, we propose Spiking Point Mamba (SPM), the first Mamba-based SNN in the 3D domain. Due to the poor performance of simply transferring Mamba to 3D SNNs, SPM is designed to utilize both the sequence modeling capabilities of Mamba and the temporal feature extraction of SNNs. Specifically, we first introduce Hierarchical Dynamic Encoding (HDE), an improved direct encoding method that effectively introduces dynamic temporal mechanism, thereby facilitating temporal interactions. Then, we propose a Spiking Mamba Block (SMB), which builds upon Mamba while learning inter-time-step features and minimizing information loss caused by spikes. Finally, to further enhance model performance, we adopt an asymmetric SNN-ANN architecture for spike-based pre-training and finetune.

While absolute positional embeddings (APE) have shown theoretical advantages over relative positional embeddings (RPE), particularly due to the ability of sinusoidal functions to preserve spatial inductive biases like monotonicity and shift invariance, a fundamental challenge arises when mapping a 2D grid to a 1D sequence. Existing methods have mostly overlooked or never explored the impact of patch ordering in positional embeddings. To address this, we propose LOOPE, a learnable patch-ordering method that optimizes spatial representation for a given set of frequencies, providing a principled approach to patch order optimization. Empirical results show that our PE significantly improves classification accuracy across various ViT architectures. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of positional embeddings, we introduce the \"Three Cell Experiment\", a novel benchmarking framework that assesses the ability of PEs to retain relative and absolute positional information across different ViT architectures. Unlike standard evaluations, which typically report a performance gap of 4 to 6% between models with and without PE, our method reveals a striking 30 to 35% difference, offering a more sensitive diagnostic tool to measure the efficacy of PEs.

In this work, we investigate whether such pedagogically rich, yet non-standardized and heterogeneous videos can effectively teach general-domain vision-language models biomedical knowledge. To this end, we introduce OpenBiomedVi, a biomedical video instruction tuning dataset comprising 1031 hours of video-caption and Q/A pairs, curated through a multi-step human-in-the-loop pipeline. Diverse biomedical video datasets are rare, and OpenBiomedVid fills an important gap by providing instruction-style supervision grounded in real-world educational content. Surprisingly, despite the informal and heterogeneous nature of these videos, the fine-tuned Qwen-2-VL models exhibit substantial performance improvements across most benchmarks. The 2B model achieves gains of 98.7% on video tasks, 71.2% on image tasks, and 0.2% on text tasks.

Among various approaches, robust visual tracking that combines RGB frames with Event streams has attracted increasing attention from researchers. While striving for high accuracy and efficiency in tracking, it is also important to explore how to effectively conduct adversarial attacks and defenses on RGB-Event stream tracking algorithms, yet research in this area remains relatively scarce. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a cross-modal adversarial attack algorithm for RGB-Event visual tracking. Because of the diverse representations of Event streams, and given that Event voxels and frames are more commonly used, this paper will focus on these two representations for an in-depth study. Specifically, for the RGB-Event voxel, we first optimize the perturbation by adversarial loss to generate RGB frame adversarial examples. For discrete Event voxel representations, we propose a two-step attack strategy, more in detail, we first inject Event voxels into the target region as initialized adversarial examples, then, conduct a gradient-guided optimization by perturbing the spatial location of the Event voxels. For the RGB-Event frame based tracking, we optimize the cross-modal universal perturbation by integrating the gradient information from multimodal data. We evaluate the proposed approach against attacks on three widely used RGB-Event Tracking datasets, i.e., COESOT, FE108, and VisEvent.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14446v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Including children's images in datasets has raised ethical concerns, particularly regarding privacy, consent, data protection, and accountability. These datasets, often built by scraping publicly available images from the Internet, can expose children to risks such as exploitation, profiling, and tracking. Despite the growing recognition of these issues, approaches for addressing them remain limited. We explore the ethical implications of using children's images in AI datasets and propose a pipeline to detect and remove such images. As a use case, we built the pipeline on a Vision-Language Model under the Visual Question Answering task and tested it on the #PraCegoVer dataset. We also evaluate the pipeline on a subset of 100,000 images from the Open Images V7 dataset to assess its effectiveness in detecting and removing images of children. The pipeline serves as a baseline for future research, providing a starting point for more comprehensive tools and methodologies. While we leverage existing models trained on potentially problematic data, our goal is to expose and address this issue. We do not advocate for training or deploying such models, but instead call for urgent community reflection and action to protect children's rights. Ultimately, we aim to encourage the research community to exercise - more than an additional - care in creating new datasets and to inspire the development of tools to protect the fundamental rights of vulnerable groups, particularly children.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14450v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Counterfactual medical image generation effectively addresses data scarcity and enhances the interpretability of medical images. However, due to the complex and diverse pathological features of medical images and the imbalanced class distribution in medical data, generating high-quality and diverse medical images from limited data is significantly challenging. Additionally, to fully leverage the information in limited data, such as anatomical structure information and generate more structurally stable medical images while avoiding distortion or inconsistency. In this paper, in order to enhance the clinical relevance of generated data and improve the interpretability of the model, we propose a novel medical image generation framework, which generates independent pathological and structural features based on causal disentanglement and utilizes text-guided modeling of pathological features to regulate the generation of counterfactual images. First, we achieve feature separation through causal disentanglement and analyze the interactions between features. Here, we introduce group supervision to ensure the independence of pathological and identity features. Second, we leverage a diffusion model guided by pathological findings to model pathological features, enabling the generation of diverse counterfactual images. Meanwhile, we enhance accuracy by leveraging a large language model to extract lesion severity and location from medical reports. Additionally, we improve the performance of the latent diffusion model on long-tailed categories through initial noise optimization.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14460v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has advanced novel view synthesis by utilizing Gaussians to represent scenes. Encoding Gaussian point features with anchor embeddings has significantly enhanced the performance of newer 3DGS variants. While significant advances have been made, it is still challenging to boost rendering performance. Feature embeddings have difficulty accurately representing colors from different perspectives under varying lighting conditions, which leads to a washed-out appearance. Another reason is the lack of a proper densification strategy that prevents Gaussian point growth in thinly initialized areas, resulting in blurriness and needle-shaped artifacts. To address them, we propose Metamon-GS, from innovative viewpoints of variance-guided densification strategy and multi-level hash grid. The densification strategy guided by variance specifically targets Gaussians with high gradient variance in pixels and compensates for the importance of regions with extra Gaussians to improve reconstruction. The latter studies implicit global lighting conditions and accurately interprets color from different perspectives and feature embeddings. Our thorough experiments on publicly available datasets show that Metamon-GS surpasses its baseline model and previous versions, delivering superior quality in rendering novel views.",

Previous works address this challenge by utilizing Vision-Language Models and mask proposal networks for region-text matching. However, this paradigm may lead to incorrect target localization due to the inherent ambiguity and diversity of free-form referring expressions. To alleviate this issue, we present LGD (Leveraging Generative Descriptions), a framework that utilizes the advanced language generation capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models to enhance region-text matching performance in Vision-Language Models. Specifically, we first design two kinds of prompts, the attribute prompt and the surrounding prompt, to guide the Multi-Modal Large Language Models in generating descriptions related to the crucial attributes of the referent object and the details of surrounding objects, referred to as attribute description and surrounding description, respectively. Secondly, three visual-text matching scores are introduced to evaluate the similarity between instance-level visual features and textual features, which determines the mask most associated with the referring expression.

While diffusion transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in high-quality video generation, scaling them to 2K resolution remains computationally prohibitive due to quadratic growth in memory and processing costs. In this work, we propose Turbo2K, an efficient and practical framework for generating detail-rich 2K videos while significantly improving training and inference efficiency. First, Turbo2K operates in a highly compressed latent space, reducing computational complexity and memory footprint, making high-resolution video synthesis feasible. However, the high compression ratio of the VAE and limited model size impose constraints on generative quality. To mitigate this, we introduce a knowledge distillation strategy that enables a smaller student model to inherit the generative capacity of a larger, more powerful teacher model. Our analysis reveals that, despite differences in latent spaces and architectures, DiTs exhibit structural similarities in their internal representations, facilitating effective knowledge transfer. Second, we design a hierarchical two-stage synthesis framework that first generates multi-level feature at lower resolutions before guiding high-resolution video generation. This approach ensures structural coherence and fine-grained detail refinement while eliminating redundant encoding-decoding overhead, further enhancing computational efficiency.Turbo2K achieves state-of-the-art efficiency, generating 5-second, 24fps, 2K videos with significantly reduced computational cost. Compared to existing methods, Turbo2K is up to 20$\\times$ faster for inference, making high-resolution video generation more scalable and practical for real-world applications.",

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{PICO}, an INR-based framework for static point cloud compression. Unlike prevailing encoder-decoder paradigms, we decompose the point cloud compression task into two separate stages: geometry compression and attribute compression, each with distinct INR optimization objectives. Inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce a novel network architecture, \\textbf{LeAFNet}, which leverages learnable activation functions in the latent space to better approximate the target signal's implicit function. By reformulating point cloud compression as neural parameter compression, we further improve compression efficiency through quantization and entropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that \\textbf{LeAFNet} outperforms conventional MLPs in INR-based point cloud compression. Furthermore, \\textbf{PICO} achieves superior geometry compression performance compared to the current MPEG point cloud compression standard, yielding an average improvement of $4.92$ dB in D1 PSNR.

We attribute this challenge to the inherent texture bias in VFMs, which is exacerbated during fine-tuning and limits generalization in texture-sparse environments. To address this, we propose Ladder Shape-bias Representation Side-tuning (LSR-ST), a lightweight PEFT framework that enhances model robustness by introducing shape-biased inductive priors. LSR-ST captures shape-aware features using a simple HDConv Block, which integrates large-kernel attention and residual learning. The method satisfies three key conditions for inducing shape bias: large receptive fields, multi-order feature interactions, and sparse connectivity. Our analysis reveals that these improvements stem from representation efficiency-the ability to extract task-relevant, structurally grounded features while minimizing redundancy. We formalize this concept via Information Bottleneck theory and advocate for it as a key PEFT objective. Unlike traditional NLP paradigms that focus on optimizing parameters and memory, visual tasks require models that extract task-defined semantics, rather than just relying on pre-encoded features. This shift enables our approach to move beyond conventional trade-offs, offering more robust and generalizable solutions for vision tasks. With minimal changes to SAM2-UNet, LSR-ST achieves consistent improvements across 17 datasets and 6 tasks using only 4.719M trainable parameters. These results highlight the potential of representation efficiency for robust and adaptable VFMs within complex visual environments.",

Finally, we propose a gradient-enhanced super-resolution method to extract fine-grained TIR target features and improve the resolution of TIR images, addressing performance degradation in tracking caused by low-resolution sequences. To the best of our knowledge, STARS is the first to integrate super-resolution methods within a sparse learning-based CF framework.

Unlike the typical face swapping training process, which often relies on implicit supervision and struggles to achieve satisfactory results. DreamID establishes explicit supervision for face swapping by constructing Triplet ID Group data, significantly enhancing identity similarity and attribute preservation. The iterative nature of diffusion models poses challenges for utilizing efficient image-space loss functions, as performing time-consuming multi-step sampling to obtain the generated image during training is impractical. To address this issue, we leverage the accelerated diffusion model SD Turbo, reducing the inference steps to a single iteration, enabling efficient pixel-level end-to-end training with explicit Triplet ID Group supervision. Additionally, we propose an improved diffusion-based model architecture comprising SwapNet, FaceNet, and ID Adapter. This robust architecture fully unlocks the power of the Triplet ID Group explicit supervision. Finally, to further extend our method, we explicitly modify the Triplet ID Group data during training to fine-tune and preserve specific attributes, such as glasses and face shape. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of identity similarity, pose and expression preservation, and image fidelity.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14516v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Traditional SLAM systems, which rely on bundle adjustment, struggle with highly dynamic scenes commonly found in casual videos. Such videos entangle the motion of dynamic elements, undermining the assumption of static environments required by traditional systems. Existing techniques either filter out dynamic elements or model their motion independently. However, the former often results in incomplete reconstructions, whereas the latter can lead to inconsistent motion estimates. Taking a novel approach, this work leverages a 3D point tracker to separate the camera-induced motion from the observed motion of dynamic objects. By considering only the camera-induced component, bundle adjustment can operate reliably on all scene elements as a result. We further ensure depth consistency across video frames with lightweight post-processing based on scale maps. Our framework combines the core of traditional SLAM -- bundle adjustment -- with a robust learning-based 3D tracker front-end. Integrating motion decomposition, bundle adjustment and depth refinement, our unified framework, BA-Track, accurately tracks the camera motion and produces temporally coherent and scale-consistent dense reconstructions, accommodating both static and dynamic elements.

However, their effectiveness in specialized, safety-critical domains like autonomous driving remains largely unexplored. Autonomous driving systems require sophisticated scene understanding in complex environments, yet existing multimodal benchmarks primarily focus on normal driving conditions, failing to adequately assess VLLMs' performance in safety-critical scenarios. To address this, we introduce DVBench, a pioneering benchmark designed to evaluate the performance of VLLMs in understanding safety-critical driving videos. Built around a hierarchical ability taxonomy that aligns with widely adopted frameworks for describing driving scenarios used in assessing highly automated driving systems, DVBench features 10,000 multiple-choice questions with human-annotated ground-truth answers, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of VLLMs' capabilities in perception and reasoning. Experiments on 14 SOTA VLLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 72B parameters, reveal significant performance gaps, with no model achieving over 40% accuracy, highlighting critical limitations in understanding complex driving scenarios. To probe adaptability, we fine-tuned selected models using domain-specific data from DVBench, achieving accuracy gains ranging from 5.24 to 10.94 percentage points, with relative improvements of up to 43.59%. This improvement underscores the necessity of targeted adaptation to bridge the gap between general-purpose VLLMs and mission-critical driving applications.

However, this approach primarily minimizes the loss of mean squared error (MSE) at the pixel level, neglecting the need for global optimization at the image level, which is crucial for achieving high perceptual quality and structural coherence. In this paper, we introduce Self-sUpervised Direct preference Optimization (SUDO), a novel paradigm that optimizes both fine-grained details at the pixel level and global image quality. By integrating direct preference optimization into the model, SUDO generates preference image pairs in a self-supervised manner, enabling the model to prioritize global-level learning while complementing the pixel-level MSE loss. As an effective alternative to supervised fine-tuning, SUDO can be seamlessly applied to any text-to-image diffusion model. Importantly, it eliminates the need for costly data collection and annotation efforts typically associated with traditional direct preference optimization methods. Through extensive experiments on widely-used models, including Stable Diffusion 1.5 and XL, we demonstrate that SUDO significantly enhances both global and local image quality.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14606v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Human instance matting aims to estimate an alpha matte for each human instance in an image, which is challenging as it easily fails in complex cases requiring disentangling mingled pixels belonging to multiple instances along hairy and thin boundary structures. In this work, we address this by introducing MP-Mat, a novel 3D-and-instance-aware matting framework with multiplane representation, where the multiplane concept is designed from two different perspectives: scene geometry level and instance level. Specifically, we first build feature-level multiplane representations to split the scene into multiple planes based on depth differences. This approach makes the scene representation 3D-aware, and can serve as an effective clue for splitting instances in different 3D positions, thereby improving interpretability and boundary handling ability especially in occlusion areas. Then, we introduce another multiplane representation that splits the scene in an instance-level perspective, and represents each instance with both matte and color. We also treat background as a special instance, which is often overlooked by existing methods. Such an instance-level representation facilitates both foreground and background content awareness, and is useful for other down-stream tasks like image editing. Once built, the representation can be reused to realize controllable instance-level image editing with high efficiency. Extensive experiments validate the clear advantage of MP-Mat in matting task. We also demonstrate its superiority in image editing tasks, an area under-explored by existing matting-focused methods, where our approach under zero-shot inference even outperforms trained specialized image editing techniques by large margins.

Detecting lung cancer manually using chest X-Ray image or Computational Tomography (CT) scans image poses significant challenges for radiologists. Hence, there is a need for automatic diagnosis system of lung cancers from radiology images. With the recent emergence of deep learning, particularly through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the automated detection of lung cancer has become a much simpler task. Nevertheless, numerous researchers have addressed that the performance of conventional CNNs may be hindered due to class imbalance issue, which is prevalent in medical images. In this research work, we have proposed a novel CNN architecture ``Multi-Scale Dense Network (MSD-Net)'' (trained-from-scratch). The novelties we bring in the proposed model are (I) We introduce novel dense modules in the 4th block and 5th block of the CNN model. We have leveraged 3 depthwise separable convolutional (DWSC) layers, and one 1x1 convolutional layer in each dense module, in order to reduce complexity of the model considerably.

Despite recent advances in art understanding, pixel-level emotion understanding still faces a dual challenge: first, the subjectivity of emotion makes it difficult for general segmentation models like SAM to adapt to emotion-oriented segmentation tasks; and second, the abstract nature of art expression makes it difficult for captioning models to balance pixel-level semantic understanding and emotion reasoning. To solve the above problems, this paper proposes the Emotion stimuli Segmentation and Explanation Model (EmoSEM) to endow the segmentation model SAM with emotion comprehension capability. First, to enable the model to perform segmentation under the guidance of emotional intent well, we introduce an emotional prompt with a learnable mask token as the conditional input for segmentation decoding. Then, we design an emotion projector to establish the association between emotion and visual features. Next, more importantly, to address emotion-visual stimuli alignment, we develop a lightweight prefix projector, a module that fuses the learned emotional mask with the corresponding emotion into a unified representation compatible with the language model.Finally, we input the joint visual, mask, and emotional tokens into the language model and output the emotional explanations. It ensures that the generated interpretations remain semantically and emotionally coherent with the visual stimuli. The method innovatively realizes end-to-end modeling from low-level pixel features to high-level emotion interpretation, providing the first interpretable fine-grained analysis framework for artistic emotion computing. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our model.",

To address this challenge, we argue that it is necessary to introduce the kernel prior into deep learning methods, as the kernel prior remains independent of the image context. For effective fusion of kernel prior information, we adopt a rational implementation method inspired by traditional deblurring algorithms that perform deconvolution in the frequency domain. We propose a module called Frequency Integration Module (FIM) for fusing the kernel prior and combine it with a frequency-based deblurring Transfomer network.

However, the performance of the predictive coding networks is limited by their error feedback mechanism, which traditionally employs either local or global recurrent updates, leading to suboptimal performance in processing both local and broader details simultaneously. In addition, traditional predictive coding networks face difficulties in dynamically adjusting to the complexity and context of varying input data, which is crucial for achieving high levels of performance in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, there is a gap in the development and application of specific loss functions that could more effectively guide the model towards optimal performance. To deal with these issues, this paper introduces a hybrid prediction error feedback mechanism with dynamic modulation for deep predictive coding networks by effectively combining global contexts and local details while adjusting feedback based on input complexity. Additionally, we present a loss function tailored to this framework to improve accuracy by focusing on precise prediction error minimization.

Existing approaches rely on spatial visual tokens, where image patches are encoded and arranged according to a spatial order (e.g., raster scan). However, we show that spatial tokens lack the recursive structure inherent to languages, hence form an impossible language for LLM to master. In this paper, we build a proper visual language by leveraging diffusion timesteps to learn discrete, recursive visual tokens. Our proposed tokens recursively compensate for the progressive attribute loss in noisy images as timesteps increase, enabling the diffusion model to reconstruct the original image at any timestep. This approach allows us to effectively integrate the strengths of LLMs in autoregressive reasoning and diffusion models in precise image generation, achieving seamless multimodal comprehension and generation within a unified framework.

Recently, supervised learning approaches have gained attention for reconstructing 3D spinal anatomy from sparse fluoroscopic data, significantly reducing reliance on radiation-intensive 3D imaging systems. However, these methods typically require large amounts of annotated training data and may struggle to generalize across varying patient anatomies or imaging conditions. Instance-learning approaches like Gaussian splatting could offer an alternative by avoiding extensive annotation requirements. While Gaussian splatting has shown promise for novel view synthesis, its application to sparse, arbitrarily posed real intraoperative X-rays has remained largely unexplored. This work addresses this limitation by extending the $R^2$-Gaussian splatting framework to reconstruct anatomically consistent 3D volumes under these challenging conditions. We introduce an anatomy-guided radiographic standardization step using style transfer, improving visual consistency across views, and enhancing reconstruction quality. Notably, our framework requires no pretraining, making it inherently adaptable to new patients and anatomies. We evaluated our approach using an ex-vivo dataset. Expert surgical evaluation confirmed the clinical utility of the 3D reconstructions for navigation, especially when using 20 to 30 views, and highlighted the standardization's benefit for anatomical clarity. Benchmarking via quantitative 2D metrics (PSNR/SSIM) confirmed performance trade-offs compared to idealized settings, but also validated the improvement gained from standardization over raw inputs.

They offer advantages over traditional optimization-based planning algorithms. These advantages include fewer manually selected parameters and faster development. Within ML-based planning, imitation learning (IL) is a common algorithm. It primarily learns driving policies directly from supervised trajectory data. While IL has demonstrated strong performance on many open-loop benchmarks, it remains challenging to determine if the learned policy truly understands fundamental driving principles, rather than simply extrapolating from the ego-vehicle's initial state. Several studies have identified this limitation and proposed algorithms to address it. However, these methods often use original datasets for evaluation. In these datasets, future trajectories are heavily dependent on initial conditions. Furthermore, IL often overfits to the most common scenarios. It struggles to generalize to rare or unseen situations.\n  To address these challenges, this work proposes: 1) a novel closed-loop simulator supporting both imitation and reinforcement learning, 2) a causal benchmark derived from the Waymo Open Dataset to rigorously assess the impact of the copycat problem, and 3) a novel framework integrating imitation learning and reinforcement learning to overcome the limitations of purely imitative approaches.

    "title": "SuperCL: Superpixel Guided Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation Pre-training",
    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14737v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical yet challenging task, primarily due to the difficulty of obtaining extensive datasets of high-quality, expert-annotated images. Contrastive learning presents a potential but still problematic solution to this issue. Because most existing methods focus on extracting instance-level or pixel-to-pixel representation, which ignores the characteristics between intra-image similar pixel groups. Moreover, when considering contrastive pairs generation, most SOTA methods mainly rely on manually setting thresholds, which requires a large number of gradient experiments and lacks efficiency and generalization. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach named SuperCL for medical image segmentation pre-training. Specifically, our SuperCL exploits the structural prior and pixel correlation of images by introducing two novel contrastive pairs generation strategies: Intra-image Local Contrastive Pairs (ILCP) Generation and Inter-image Global Contrastive Pairs (IGCP) Generation. Considering superpixel cluster aligns well with the concept of contrastive pairs generation, we utilize the superpixel map to generate pseudo masks for both ILCP and IGCP to guide supervised contrastive learning. Moreover, we also propose two modules named Average SuperPixel Feature Map Generation (ASP) and Connected Components Label Generation (CCL) to better exploit the prior structural information for IGCP. Finally, experiments on 8 medical image datasets indicate our SuperCL outperforms existing 12 methods. i.e. Our SuperCL achieves a superior performance with more precise predictions from visualization figures and 3.15%, 5.44%, 7.89% DSC higher than the previous best results on MMWHS, CHAOS, Spleen with 10% annotations. Our code will be released after acceptance.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14753v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the prevailing transition from single-task to multi-task approaches in video anomaly detection, we observe that many adopt sub-optimal frameworks for individual proxy tasks. Motivated by this, we contend that optimizing single-task frameworks can advance both single- and multi-task approaches. Accordingly, we leverage middle-frame prediction as the primary proxy task, and introduce an effective hybrid framework designed to generate accurate predictions for normal frames and flawed predictions for abnormal frames. This hybrid framework is built upon a bi-directional structure that seamlessly integrates both vision transformers and ConvLSTMs. Specifically, we utilize this bi-directional structure to fully analyze the temporal dimension by predicting frames in both forward and backward directions, significantly boosting the detection stability. Given the transformer's capacity to model long-range contextual dependencies, we develop a convolutional temporal transformer that efficiently associates feature maps from all context frames to generate attention-based predictions for target frames. Furthermore, we devise a layer-interactive ConvLSTM bridge that facilitates the smooth flow of low-level features across layers and time-steps, thereby strengthening predictions with fine details. Anomalies are eventually identified by scrutinizing the discrepancies between target frames and their corresponding predictions. Several experiments conducted on public benchmarks affirm the efficacy of our hybrid framework, whether used as a standalone single-task approach or integrated as a branch in a multi-task approach. These experiments also underscore the advantages of merging vision transformers and ConvLSTMs for video anomaly detection.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14783v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from \"noisy\" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost.

Dataset distillation is a potential solution to this problem, yet current distillation techniques are a blank canvas in the field of image restoration. To fill this gap, we propose the Distribution-aware Dataset Distillation method (TripleD), a new framework that extends the principles of dataset distillation to image restoration. Specifically, TripleD uses a pre-trained vision Transformer to extract features from images for complexity evaluation, and the subset (the number of samples is much smaller than the original training set) is selected based on complexity. The selected subset is then fed through a lightweight CNN that fine-tunes the image distribution to align with the distribution of the original dataset at the feature level. To efficiently condense knowledge, the training is divided into two stages. Early stages focus on simpler, low-complexity samples to build foundational knowledge, while later stages select more complex and uncertain samples as the model matures. Our method achieves promising performance on multiple image restoration tasks, including multi-task image restoration, all-in-one image restoration, and ultra-high-definition image restoration tasks. Note that we can train a state-of-the-art image restoration model on an ultra-high-definition (4K resolution) dataset using only one consumer-grade GPU in less than 8 hours (500 savings in computing resources and immeasurable training time).",

However, existing approaches often overlook the quality variations in local features and fail to fully leverage the complementary information across modalities, particularly in the case of low-quality features. In this paper, we propose to address this issue by leveraging a novel graph reasoning model, termed the Modality-aware Graph Reasoning Network (MGRNet). Specifically, we first construct modality-aware graphs to enhance the extraction of fine-grained local details by effectively capturing and modeling the relationships between patches. Subsequently, the selective graph nodes swap operation is employed to alleviate the adverse effects of low-quality local features by considering both local and global information, enhancing the representation of discriminative information. Finally, the swapped modality-aware graphs are fed into the local-aware graph reasoning module, which propagates multi-modal information to yield a reliable feature representation. Another advantage of the proposed graph reasoning approach is its ability to reconstruct missing modal information by exploiting inherent structural relationships, thereby minimizing disparities between different modalities. Experimental results on four benchmarks (RGBNT201, Market1501-MM, RGBNT100, MSVR310) indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-modal object ReID.

We further enhance calibration through a two-stage training process combining supervised fine-tuning on the perturbed dataset with subsequent preference optimization. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the alignment between verbalized confidence and response correctness while maintaining or enhancing overall task performance.

Due to these perspectives, we propose PseudoFormer, a novel two-branch framework that bridges the gap between weakly and fully-supervised Temporal Action Localization (TAL). We first introduce RickerFusion, which maps all predicted action proposals to a global shared space to generate pseudo labels with better quality. Subsequently, we leverage both snippet-level and proposal-level labels with different priors from the weak branch to train the regression-based model in the full branch.

Online learning, which processes streaming data in real-time, offers a promising solution to these issues while also allowing swift adaptations in scenarios demanding real-time responsiveness. One strategy to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of learning involves identifying and prioritizing data that enhances performance on target downstream tasks. We propose Relevance and Specificity-based online filtering framework (ReSpec) that selects data based on four criteria: (i) modality alignment for clean data, (ii) task relevance for target focused data, (iii) specificity for informative and detailed data, and (iv) efficiency for low-latency processing. Relevance is determined by the probabilistic alignment of incoming data with downstream tasks, while specificity employs the distance to a root embedding representing the least specific data as an efficient proxy for informativeness.

Existing methods generate or enhance missing details in low-quality spectra data using the high-quality one, generally called the primary spectrum, but how to justify the primary spectrum is a challenging problem. In addition, when the quality of the primary spectrum is low, the enhancement effect would be greatly degraded, thus limiting the performance of multi-spectral vehicle ReID. To address these problems, we propose the Collaborative Enhancement Network (CoEN), which generates a high-quality proxy from all spectra data and leverages it to supervise the selection of primary spectrum and enhance all spectra features in a collaborative manner, for robust multi-spectral vehicle ReID. First, to integrate the rich cues from all spectra data, we design the Proxy Generator (PG) to progressively aggregate multi-spectral features. Second, we design the Dynamic Quality Sort Module (DQSM), which sorts all spectra data by measuring their correlations with the proxy, to accurately select the primary spectra with the highest correlation. Finally, we design the Collaborative Enhancement Module (CEM) to effectively compensate for missing contents of all spectra by collaborating the primary spectra and the proxy, thereby mitigating the impact of low-quality primary spectra.

In such complex contexts, the increasing pattern diversity has brought two challenges to reconstruction-based approaches: (1) over-generalization: anomalies that are subtle or share compositional similarities with normal patterns may be reconstructed with high fidelity, making them difficult to distinguish from normal instances; and (2) insufficient normality reconstruction: complex normal features, such as intricate textures or fine-grained structures, may not be faithfully reconstructed due to the model's limited representational capacity, resulting in false positives. Existing methods typically focus on addressing the former, which unintentionally exacerbate the latter, resulting in inadequate representation of intricate normal patterns. To concurrently address these two challenges, we propose a Memory-augmented Dual-Decoder Networks (MDD-Net). This network includes two critical components: a Dual-Decoder Reverse Distillation Network (DRD-Net) and a Class-aware Memory Module (CMM). Specifically, the DRD-Net incorporates a restoration decoder designed to recover normal features from synthetic abnormal inputs and an identity decoder to reconstruct features that maintain the anomalous semantics. By exploiting the discrepancy between features produced by two decoders, our approach refines anomaly scores beyond the conventional encoder-decoder comparison paradigm, effectively reducing false positives and enhancing localization accuracy. Furthermore, the CMM explicitly encodes and preserves class-specific normal prototypes, actively steering the network away from anomaly reconstruction. Comprehensive experimental results across several benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of our MDD-Net framework over current SoTA approaches in multi-class UAD tasks.",

Although general prompts have been explored in prior works, achieving their stable optimization and effective deployment remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose GenCLIP, a novel framework that learns and leverages general prompts more effectively through multi-layer prompting and dual-branch inference. Multi-layer prompting integrates category-specific visual cues from different CLIP layers, enriching general prompts with more comprehensive and robust feature representations. By combining general prompts with multi-layer visual features, our method further enhances its generalization capability. To balance specificity and generalization, we introduce a dual-branch inference strategy, where a vision-enhanced branch captures fine-grained category-specific features, while a query-only branch prioritizes generalization. The complementary outputs from both branches improve the stability and reliability of anomaly detection across unseen categories.

    "title": "Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong Spatial-Temporal Consistency in the Frequency Domain on Videos",
    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14921v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adversarial Training (AT) has been shown to significantly enhance adversarial robustness via a min-max optimization approach. However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14933v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In today's age of social media and marketing, copyright issues can be a major roadblock to the free sharing of images. Generative AI models have made it possible to create high-quality images, but concerns about copyright infringement are a hindrance to their abundant use. As these models use data from training images to generate new ones, it is often a daunting task to ensure they do not violate intellectual property rights. Some AI models have even been noted to directly copy copyrighted images, a problem often referred to as source copying. Traditional copyright protection measures such as watermarks and metadata have also proven to be futile in this regard. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step image generation model inspired by the conditional diffusion model. The first step involves creating an image segmentation mask for some prompt-based generated images. This mask embodies the shape of the image. Thereafter, the diffusion model is asked to generate the image anew while avoiding the shape in question. This approach shows a decrease in structural similarity from the training image, i.e. we are able to avoid the source copying problem using this approach without expensive retraining of the model or user-centered prompt generation techniques. This makes our approach the most computationally inexpensive approach to avoiding both copyright infringement and source copying for diffusion model-based image generation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14952v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Deep learning algorithms have significantly reduced the computational time and improved the spatial resolution of particle image velocimetry~(PIV). However, the models trained on synthetic datasets might have a degraded performance on practical particle images due to domain gaps. As a result, special residual patterns are often observed for the vector fields of deep learning-based estimators. To reduce the special noise step-by-step, we employ a denoising diffusion model~(FlowDiffuser) for PIV analysis. And the data-hungry iterative denoising diffusion model is trained via a transfer learning strategy, resulting in our PIV-FlowDiffuser method. Specifically, (1) pre-training a FlowDiffuser model with multiple optical flow datasets of the computer vision community, such as Sintel, KITTI, etc; (2) fine-tuning the pre-trained model on synthetic PIV datasets. Note that the PIV images are upsampled by a factor of two to resolve the small-scale turbulent flow structures. The visualized results indicate that our PIV-FlowDiffuser effectively suppresses the noise patterns. Therefore, the denoising diffusion model reduces the average end-point error~($AEE$) by 59.4% over RAFT256-PIV baseline on the classic Cai's dataset. Besides, PIV-FlowDiffuser exhibits enhanced generalization performance on unseen particle images due to transfer learning. Overall, this study highlights the transfer-learning-based denoising diffusion models for PIV. And a detailed implementation is recommended for interested readers in the repository https://github.com/Zhu-Qianyu/PIV-FlowDiffuser.",

In specific, we introduce an expressive and compact representation that encodes texture-related attributes of the 3D Gaussians in the tensorial format. We store appearance of neutral expression in static tri-planes, and represents dynamic texture details for different expressions using lightweight 1D feature lines, which are then decoded into opacity offset relative to the neutral face. We further propose adaptive truncated opacity penalty and class-balanced sampling to improve generalization across different expressions.

Existing methods often struggle to maintain accurate alignment, leading to noticeable discrepancies. To address this issue, we propose \\name{}, a new framework that enhances controllable 3D generation by explicitly encouraging cyclic consistency between the second-order 3D content, generated based on extracted signals from the first-order generation, and its original input controls. Specifically, we employ an efficient feed-forward backbone that can generate a 3D object from an input condition and a text prompt. Given an initial viewpoint and a control signal, a novel view is rendered from the generated 3D content, from which the extracted condition is used to regenerate the 3D content. This re-generated output is then rendered back to the initial viewpoint, followed by another round of control signal extraction, forming a cyclic process with two consistency constraints. \\emph{View consistency} ensures coherence between the two generated 3D objects, measured by semantic similarity to accommodate generative diversity. \\emph{Condition consistency} aligns the final extracted signal with the original input control, preserving structural or geometric details throughout the process. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks demonstrate that \\name{} significantly improves controllability, especially for fine-grained details, outperforming existing methods across various conditions (e.g., +14.17\\% PSNR for edge, +6.26\\% PSNR for sketch).",

To tackle these issues, prior work has largely focused on injecting pose and appearance guidance via elaborate bypass networks, but often struggles to generalize to open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that, as long as the foundation model is powerful enough, straightforward model modifications with flexible fine-tuning strategies can largely address the above challenges, taking a step towards controllable character animation in the wild. Specifically, we introduce RealisDance-DiT, built upon the Wan-2.1 video foundation model. Our sufficient analysis reveals that the widely adopted Reference Net design is suboptimal for large-scale DiT models. Instead, we demonstrate that minimal modifications to the foundation model architecture yield a surprisingly strong baseline. We further propose the low-noise warmup and \"large batches and small iterations\" strategies to accelerate model convergence during fine-tuning while maximally preserving the priors of the foundation model. In addition, we introduce a new test dataset that captures diverse real-world challenges, complementing existing benchmarks such as TikTok dataset and UBC fashion video dataset, to comprehensively evaluate the proposed method.

This dataset is collected from the Kwai Platform, which is composed of two parts, i.e., synthetic and wild parts. Among them, the synthetic dataset, including 1,900 image pairs, is produced by simulating the degradation following the distribution of real-world low-quality short-form UGC images, aiming to provide the ground truth for training and objective comparison in the validation/testing. The wild dataset contains low-quality images collected directly from the Kwai Platform, which are filtered using the quality assessment method KVQ from the Kwai Platform. As a result, the KwaiSR dataset contains 1800 synthetic image pairs and 1900 wild images, which are divided into training, validation, and testing parts with a ratio of 8:1:1.

One effective solution involves watermarking the generated images. Existing methods primarily focus on ensuring that watermark embedding does not degrade the model performance. However, they often overlook critical challenges in real-world deployment scenarios, such as the complexity of watermark key management, user-defined generation parameters, and the difficulty of verification by arbitrary third parties. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Shading++, a diffusion model watermarking method tailored for real-world deployment. We propose a double-channel design that leverages pseudorandom error-correcting codes to encode the random seed required for watermark pseudorandomization, achieving performance-lossless watermarking under a fixed watermark key and overcoming key management challenges. Additionally, we model the distortions introduced during generation and inversion as an additive white Gaussian noise channel and employ a novel soft decision decoding strategy during extraction, ensuring strong robustness even when generation parameters vary. To enable third-party verification, we incorporate public key signatures, which provide a certain level of resistance against forgery attacks even when model inversion capabilities are fully disclosed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Gaussian Shading++ not only maintains performance losslessness but also outperforms existing methods in terms of robustness, making it a more practical solution for real-world deployment.",

The existing solutions include rehearsal-based and rehearsal-free methods to address this challenge. Rehearsal-based approaches rely on knowledge distillation, continuously accumulating forgetting during the distillation process. Rehearsal-free methods insufficiently learn the distribution of each domain, leading to forgetfulness over time. To solve these issues, we propose a novel Distribution-aware Forgetting Compensation (DAFC) model that explores cross-domain shared representation learning and domain-specific distribution integration without using old exemplars or knowledge distillation. We propose a Text-driven Prompt Aggregation (TPA) that utilizes text features to enrich prompt elements and guide the prompt model to learn fine-grained representations for each instance. This can enhance the differentiation of identity information and establish the foundation for domain distribution awareness. Then, Distribution-based Awareness and Integration (DAI) is designed to capture each domain-specific distribution by a dedicated expert network and adaptively consolidate them into a shared region in high-dimensional space. In this manner, DAI can consolidate and enhance cross-domain shared representation learning while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, we develop a Knowledge Consolidation Mechanism (KCM) that comprises instance-level discrimination and cross-domain consistency alignment strategies to facilitate model adaptive learning of new knowledge from the current domain and promote knowledge consolidation learning between acquired domain-specific distributions, respectively.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.15118v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound within an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard in SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector each, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous work samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates all local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from optimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual target in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic issue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots competitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and off-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio are used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention matching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method achieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL, and substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.",

We demonstrate how the rectification of stereo image pairs simplifies the process of surface normal estimation by reducing computational complexity. To address noise reduction, we develop a custom algorithm inspired by convolutional operations, tailored to process disparity data efficiently. We also introduce adaptive heuristic techniques for efficiently detecting connected surface components within the images, further improving the robustness of the method. By integrating these methods, we construct a surface normal estimator that is both fast and accurate, producing a dense, oriented point cloud as the final output. Our method is validated using both simulated environments and real-world stereo images from the Middlebury and Cityscapes datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in real-time performance and accuracy when implemented on a GPU.

Existing dynamic novel view synthesis (NVS) methods are highly sensitive to motion blur in casually captured videos, resulting in significant degradation of rendering quality. While recent approaches address motion-blurred inputs for NVS, they primarily focus on static scene reconstruction and lack dedicated motion modeling for dynamic objects. To overcome these limitations, our MoBGS introduces a novel Blur-adaptive Latent Camera Estimation (BLCE) method for effective latent camera trajectory estimation, improving global camera motion deblurring. In addition, we propose a physically-inspired Latent Camera-induced Exposure Estimation (LCEE) method to ensure consistent deblurring of both global camera and local object motion. Our MoBGS framework ensures the temporal consistency of unseen latent timestamps and robust motion decomposition of static and dynamic regions. Extensive experiments on the Stereo Blur dataset and real-world blurry videos show that our MoBGS significantly outperforms the very recent advanced methods (DyBluRF and Deblur4DGS), achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic NVS under motion blur.",

Although many previous methods attempt to mitigate intra-class variations, they often struggle with instances exhibiting complex geometries or significant deviations from canonical shapes. To address this challenge, we propose INKL-Pose, a novel category-level object pose estimation framework that enables INstance-adaptive Keypoint Learning with local-to-global geometric aggregation. Specifically, our approach first predicts semantically consistent and geometric informative keypoints through an Instance-Adaptive Keypoint Generator, then refines them with: (1) a Local Keypoint Feature Aggregator capturing fine-grained geometries, and (2) a Global Keypoint Feature Aggregator using bidirectional Mamba for structural consistency. To enable bidirectional modeling in Mamba, we introduce a Feature Sequence Flipping strategy that preserves spatial coherence while constructing backward feature sequences. Additionally, we design a surface loss and a separation loss to enforce uniform coverage and spatial diversity in keypoint distribution. The generated keypoints are finally mapped to a canonical space for regressing the object's 6D pose and size. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25, REAL275, and HouseCat6D demonstrate that INKL-Pose achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing methods.",

We compute an underlying Mood Space that 1) factors out irrelevant features and 2) finds the connections between images, thus bringing relevant concepts closer. We invent a fibration computation to compress/decompress pre-trained features into/from a compact space, 50-100x smaller. The main innovation is learning to mimic the pairwise affinity relationship of the image tokens across exemplars. To focus on the coarse-to-fine hierarchical structures in the Mood Space, we compute the top eigenvector structure from the affinity matrix and define a loss in the eigenvector space. The resulting Mood Space is locally linear and compact, allowing image-level operations, such as object averaging, visual analogy, and pose transfer, to be performed as a simple vector operation in Mood Space.

Existing registration methods rely heavily on anatomical landmark-based workflows, which encounter two major limitations: 1) ambiguous landmark definitions fail to provide efficient markers for registration; 2) insufficient integration of intraoperative liver visual information in shape deformation modeling. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a landmark-free preoperative-to-intraoperative registration framework utilizing effective self-supervised learning, termed \\ourmodel. This framework transforms the conventional 3D-2D workflow into a 3D-3D registration pipeline, which is then decoupled into rigid and non-rigid registration subtasks. \\ourmodel~first introduces a feature-disentangled transformer to learn robust correspondences for recovering rigid transformations. Further, a structure-regularized deformation network is designed to adjust the preoperative model to align with the intraoperative liver surface. This network captures structural correlations through geometry similarity modeling in a low-rank transformer network. To facilitate the validation of the registration performance, we also construct an in-vivo registration dataset containing liver resection videos of 21 patients, called \\emph{P2I-LReg}, which contains 346 keyframes that provide a global view of the liver together with liver mask annotations and calibrated camera intrinsic parameters.

To more efficiently adapt to ground object distributions while extracting image features without introducing excessive parameters and skipping redundant information, this paper proposes KANet based on an improved 3D-DenseNet model, consisting of 3D KAN Conv and an adaptive grid update mechanism. By introducing learnable univariate B-spline functions on network edges, specifically by flattening three-dimensional neighborhoods into vectors and applying B-spline-parameterized nonlinear activation functions to replace the fixed linear weights of traditional 3D convolutional kernels, we precisely capture complex spectral-spatial nonlinear relationships in hyperspectral data. Simultaneously, through a dynamic grid adjustment mechanism, we adaptively update the grid point positions of B-splines based on the statistical characteristics of input data, optimizing the resolution of spline functions to match the non-uniform distribution of spectral features, significantly improving the model's accuracy in high-dimensional data modeling and parameter efficiency, effectively alleviating the curse of dimensionality. This characteristic demonstrates superior neural scaling laws compared to traditional convolutional neural networks and reduces overfitting risks in small-sample and high-noise scenarios. KANet enhances model representation capability through a 3D dynamic expert convolution system without increasing network depth or width. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on IN, UP, and KSC datasets, outperforming mainstream hyperspectral image classification approaches.",

However, controlling these large models for image restoration usually requires a large number of high-quality images and immense computational resources for training, which is costly and not privacy-friendly. In this paper, we find that the well-trained large T2I model (i.e., Flux) is able to produce a variety of high-quality images aligned with real-world distributions, offering an unlimited supply of training samples to mitigate the above issue. Specifically, we proposed a training data construction pipeline for image restoration, namely FluxGen, which includes unconditional image generation, image selection, and degraded image simulation. A novel light-weighted adapter (FluxIR) with squeeze-and-excitation layers is also carefully designed to control the large Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based T2I model so that reasonable details can be restored.

To this end, we are the first to introduce human preference alignment into Real-ISR, a technique that has been successfully applied in Large Language Models and Text-to-Image tasks to effectively enhance the alignment of generated outputs with human preferences. Specifically, we introduce Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) into Real-ISR to achieve alignment, where DPO serves as a general alignment technique that directly learns from the human preference dataset. Nevertheless, unlike high-level tasks, the pixel-level reconstruction objectives of Real-ISR are difficult to reconcile with the image-level preferences of DPO, which can lead to the DPO being overly sensitive to local anomalies, leading to reduced generation quality. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose Direct Semantic Preference Optimization (DSPO) to align instance-level human preferences by incorporating semantic guidance, which is through two strategies: (a) semantic instance alignment strategy, implementing instance-level alignment to ensure fine-grained perceptual consistency, and (b) user description feedback strategy, mitigating hallucinations through semantic textual feedback on instance-level images. As a plug-and-play solution, DSPO proves highly effective in both one-step and multi-step SR frameworks.",

The process entails first segmenting out the eczema region from the image and then measuring the severity of eczema in the segmented region. The state-of-the-art methods for automated eczema diagnosis rely on deep neural networks such as convolutional neural network (CNN) and have shown impressive performance in accurately measuring the severity of eczema. However, these methods require massive volume of annotated data to train which can be hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for automated eczema diagnosis under limited training data regime. Our framework consists of two stages: i) Segmentation, where we use an in-context learning based algorithm called SegGPT for few-shot segmentation of eczema region from the image; ii) Feature extraction and classification, where we extract DINO features from the segmented regions and feed it to a multi-layered perceptron (MLP) for 4-class classification of eczema severity.

Existing methods commonly employ the thin plate spline (TPS) transformation or appearance flow to deform in-shop clothing for aligning with the person's body. Despite their promising performance, these methods often lack precise control over fine details, leading to inconsistencies in shape between clothing and the person's body as well as distortions in exposed limb regions. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel shape-guided clothing warping method for virtual try-on, dubbed SCW-VTON, which incorporates global shape constraints and additional limb textures to enhance the realism and consistency of the warped clothing and try-on results. To integrate global shape constraints for clothing warping, we devise a dual-path clothing warping module comprising a shape path and a flow path. The former path captures the clothing shape aligned with the person's body, while the latter path leverages the mapping between the pre- and post-deformation of the clothing shape to guide the estimation of appearance flow. Furthermore, to alleviate distortions in limb regions of try-on results, we integrate detailed limb guidance by developing a limb reconstruction network based on masked image modeling. Through the utilization of SCW-VTON, we are able to generate try-on results with enhanced clothing shape consistency and precise control over details.

With only 0.8M total video-text samples for training, our model outperforms the direct baseline employing a fixed partitioning strategy by a maximum of 8.72 in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness in performance. On Video-MME, Quicksviewer achieves SOTA under modest sequence lengths using just up to 5\\% of tokens per frame required by baselines. With this paradigm, scaling up the number of input frames reveals a clear power law of the model capabilities. It is also empirically verified that the segments generated by the cubing network can help for analyzing continuous events in videos.",

To address this, we introduce VisuLogic: a benchmark of 1,000 human-verified problems across six categories (e.g., quantitative shifts, spatial relations, attribute comparisons). These various types of questions can be evaluated to assess the visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs from multiple perspectives. We evaluate leading MLLMs on this benchmark and analyze their results to identify common failure modes.

While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness. We believe that our All-Angles Bench offers valuable insights and contribute to bridging the gap between MLLMs and human-level multi-view understanding.

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

However, patients' engagement tends to decrease over time without direct supervision, which is why there is a need for an automated monitoring system. In recent years, there has been great progress in quality assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises. Most of them only provide a binary classification if the performance is correct or incorrect, and a few provide a continuous score. This information is not sufficient for patients to improve their performance. In this work, we propose an algorithm for error classification of rehabilitation exercises, thus making the first step toward more detailed feedback to patients. We focus on skeleton-based exercise assessment, which utilizes human pose estimation to evaluate motion. Inspired by recent algorithms for quality assessment during rehabilitation exercises, we propose a Transformer-based model for the described classification. Our model is inspired by the HyperFormer method for human action recognition, and adapted to our problem and dataset. The evaluation is done on the KERAAL dataset, as it is the only medical dataset with clear error labels for the exercises, and our model significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

To improve efficiency, convolutional operators have been utilized to facilitate weight sharing and local connections, yet they are constrained by limited receptive fields. In this paper, we introduce Multiscale Tensor Summation (MTS) Factorization, a novel neural network operator that implements tensor summation at multiple scales, where each tensor to be summed is obtained through Tucker-decomposition-like mode products. Unlike other tensor decomposition methods in the literature, MTS is not introduced as a network compression tool; instead, as a new backbone neural layer. MTS not only reduces the number of parameters required while enhancing the efficiency of weight optimization compared to traditional dense layers (i.e., unfactorized weight matrices in MLP layers), but it also demonstrates clear advantages over convolutional layers. The proof-of-concept experimental comparison of the proposed MTS networks with MLPs and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) demonstrates their effectiveness across various tasks, such as classification, compression, and signal restoration. Additionally, when integrated with modern non-linear units such as the multi-head gate (MHG), also introduced in this study, the corresponding neural network, MTSNet, demonstrates a more favorable complexity-performance tradeoff compared to state-of-the-art transformers in various computer vision applications.

Beyond taxonomy, we explore the impact of PEFT across diverse domains, including language, vision, and generative modeling, showing how these techniques offer strong performance with lower resource costs.

Our representation unifies the continuous geometric properties of B-Rep primitives in different orders (e.g., surfaces and curves) and their discrete topological relations in a $\\textit{holistic latent}$ (HoLa) space. This is based on the simple observation that the topological connection between two surfaces is intrinsically tied to the geometry of their intersecting curve. Such a prior allows us to reformulate topology learning in B-Reps as a geometric reconstruction problem in Euclidean space. Specifically, we eliminate the presence of curves, vertices, and all the topological connections in the latent space by learning to distinguish and derive curve geometries from a pair of surface primitives via a neural intersection network. To this end, our holistic latent space is only defined on surfaces but encodes a full B-Rep model, including the geometry of surfaces, curves, vertices, and their topological relations. Our compact and holistic latent space facilitates the design of a first diffusion-based generator to take on a large variety of inputs including point clouds, single/multi-view images, 2D sketches, and text prompts. Our method significantly reduces ambiguities, redundancies, and incoherences among the generated B-Rep primitives, as well as training complexities inherent in prior multi-step B-Rep learning pipelines, while achieving greatly improved validity rate over current state of the art: 82% vs. $\\approx$50%.",

While recent advances like neural rendering and 3D Gaussian splatting have enabled high-quality digital human avatar creation and animation, most methods rely on multiple images or multi-view inputs, limiting their practicality for real-world use. In this paper, we propose SEGA, a novel approach for Single-imagE-based 3D drivable Gaussian head Avatar creation that combines generalized prior models with a new hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework.

We further present a hierarchical UV-space Gaussian Splatting framework that leverages FLAME-based structural priors and employs a dual-branch architecture to disentangle dynamic and static facial components effectively. The dynamic branch encodes expression-driven fine details, while the static branch focuses on expression-invariant regions, enabling efficient parameter inference and precomputation. This design maximizes the utility of limited 3D data and achieves real-time performance for animation and rendering.

The hand-crafted descriptors in classical semantic-aided registration, or the ground-truth annotation reliance in learning-based scene graph registration, impede their application in practical real-world environments. To address the challenges, we design a scene graph network to encode multiple modalities of semantic nodes: open-set semantic feature, local topology with spatial awareness, and shape feature. These modalities are fused to create compact semantic node features. The matching layers then search for correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. In the back-end, we employ a robust pose estimator to decide transformation according to the correspondences. We manage to maintain a sparse and hierarchical scene representation. Our approach demands fewer GPU resources and fewer communication bandwidth in multi-agent tasks. Moreover, we design a new data generation approach using vision foundation models and a semantic mapping module to reconstruct semantic scene graphs. It differs significantly from previous works, which rely on ground-truth semantic annotations to generate data. We validate our method in a two-agent SLAM benchmark. It significantly outperforms the hand-crafted baseline in terms of registration success rate.

In this work, we introduce a novel training paradigm aimed at enhancing robustness against transferable adversarial examples (TAEs) in a more efficient and effective way. We propose a model that exhibits random guessing behavior when presented with clean data $\\boldsymbol{x}$ as input, and generates accurate predictions when with triggered data $\\boldsymbol{x}+\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$. Importantly, the trigger $\\boldsymbol{\\tau}$ remains constant for all data instances. We refer to these models as \\textbf{models with trigger activation}. We are surprised to find that these models exhibit certain robustness against TAEs. Through the consideration of first-order gradients, we provide a theoretical analysis of this robustness. Moreover, through the joint optimization of the learnable trigger and the model, we achieve improved robustness to transferable attacks. Extensive experiments conducted across diverse datasets, evaluating a variety of attacking methods, underscore the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.",

Timely disclosure and mitigation of security vulnerabilities in T2I models are crucial for ensuring the safe deployment of generative models. We explore a novel training-free backdoor poisoning paradigm through model editing, which is recently employed for knowledge updating in large language models. Nevertheless, we reveal the potential security risks posed by model editing techniques to image generation models. In this work, we establish the principles for backdoor attacks based on model editing, and propose a relationship-driven precise backdoor poisoning method, REDEditing. Drawing on the principles of equivalent-attribute alignment and stealthy poisoning, we develop an equivalent relationship retrieval and joint-attribute transfer approach that ensures consistent backdoor image generation through concept rebinding. A knowledge isolation constraint is proposed to preserve benign generation integrity. Our method achieves an 11\\% higher attack success rate compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Remarkably, adding just one line of code enhances output naturalness while improving backdoor stealthiness by 24\\%.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14588v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Building a generalizable self-correction system is crucial for robots to recover from failures. Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure, translating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic actions remains a significant challenge. To address this gap, we build the Phoenix framework, which leverages motion instruction as a bridge to connect high-level semantic reflection with low-level robotic action correction. In this motion-based self-reflection framework, we start with a dual-process motion adjustment mechanism with MLLMs to translate the semantic reflection into coarse-grained motion instruction adjustment. To leverage this motion instruction for guiding how to correct fine-grained robotic actions, a multi-task motion-conditioned diffusion policy is proposed to integrate visual observations for high-frequency robotic action correction. By combining these two models, we could shift the demand for generalization capability from the low-level manipulation policy to the MLLMs-driven motion adjustment model and facilitate precise, fine-grained robotic action correction. Utilizing this framework, we further develop a lifelong learning method to automatically improve the model's capability from interactions with dynamic environments. The experiments conducted in both the RoboMimic simulation and real-world scenarios prove the superior generalization and robustness of our framework across a variety of manipulation tasks.

Recently, several research efforts have been made on merging these large models into a single multi-task model, particularly with simple arithmetic on parameters. Such merging methodology faces a central challenge: interference between model parameters fine-tuned on different tasks. Few recent works have focused on designing a new fine-tuning scheme that can lead to small parameter interference, however at the cost of the performance of each task-specific fine-tuned model and thereby limiting that of a merged model. To improve the performance of a merged model, we note that a fine-tuning scheme should aim for (1) smaller parameter interference and (2) better performance of each fine-tuned model on the corresponding task. In this work, we aim to design a new fine-tuning objective function to work towards these two goals. In the course of this process, we find such objective function to be strikingly similar to sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objective function, which aims to achieve generalization by finding flat minima. Drawing upon our observation, we propose to fine-tune pre-trained models via sharpness-aware minimization.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14795v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\\\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

To address this, we introduce the concept of Robust Unlearning, ensuring models are indistinguishable from retraining and resistant to adversarial recovery. To empirically evaluate whether unlearning techniques meet this security standard, we propose the Unlearning Mapping Attack (UMA), a post-unlearning verification framework that actively probes models for forgotten traces using adversarial queries. Extensive experiments on discriminative and generative tasks show that existing unlearning techniques remain vulnerable, even when passing existing verification metrics. By establishing UMA as a practical verification tool, this study sets a new standard for assessing and enhancing machine unlearning security.",

In addition, indistinct inter-class feature distributions further complicate classification tasks. Existing methods often rely on algorithmic heuristics without sufficiently analyzing the underlying data characteristics. We argue that a detailed analysis from the data perspective is essential before developing an appropriate solution. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic analytical framework for the S\\&I problem. We first summarize imbalance metrics and complexity analysis methods, highlighting the need for interpretable benchmarks to characterize S&I problems. Second, we review recent solutions for conventional, complexity-based, and extreme S&I problems, revealing methodological differences in handling various data distributions.

With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques like LoRA, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content, such as copyrighted material, private individuals, or harmful content. Despite the increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled model and 690 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18-40x compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.",

Through stochastic differential equation analysis of optimization dynamics in an analytically tractable setup, we demonstrate that the choice of optimization algorithm indeed influences fairness outcomes, particularly under severe imbalance. Furthermore, we show that when comparing two categories of optimizers, adaptive methods and stochastic methods, RMSProp (from the adaptive category) has a higher likelihood of converging to fairer minima than SGD (from the stochastic category). Building on this insight, we derive two new theoretical guarantees showing that, under appropriate conditions, RMSProp exhibits fairer parameter updates and improved fairness in a single optimization step compared to SGD. We then validate these findings through extensive experiments on three publicly available datasets, namely CelebA, FairFace, and MS-COCO, across different tasks as facial expression recognition, gender classification, and multi-label classification, using various backbones. Considering multiple fairness definitions including equalized odds, equal opportunity, and demographic parity, adaptive optimizers like RMSProp and Adam consistently outperform SGD in terms of group fairness, while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy.

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction.

In our work, we seek to invert the weak lensing signal from 2D telescope images to reconstruct a 3D map of the universe's dark matter field. While inversion typically yields a 2D projection of the dark matter field, accurate 3D maps of the dark matter distribution are essential for localizing structures of interest and testing theories of our universe. However, 3D inversion poses significant challenges. First, unlike standard 3D reconstruction that relies on multiple viewpoints, in this case, images are only observed from a single viewpoint. This challenge can be partially addressed by observing how galaxy emitters throughout the volume are lensed. However, this leads to the second challenge: the shapes and exact locations of unlensed galaxies are unknown, and can only be estimated with a very large degree of uncertainty. This introduces an overwhelming amount of noise which nearly drowns out the lensing signal completely. Previous approaches tackle this by imposing strong assumptions about the structures in the volume. We instead propose a methodology using a gravitationally-constrained neural field to flexibly model the continuous matter distribution. We take an analysis-by-synthesis approach, optimizing the weights of the neural network through a fully differentiable physical forward model to reproduce the lensing signal present in image measurements. We showcase our method on simulations, including realistic simulated measurements of dark matter distributions that mimic data from upcoming telescope surveys. Our results show that our method can not only outperform previous methods, but importantly is also able to recover potentially surprising dark matter structures.",

Our results show that attention patterns strongly relate to key dates, which are often associated with critical phenological events for crop-type classification. Further, the sensitivity analysis reveals the limited capability of the attention weights to characterize crop phenology as the identified phenological events depend on the other crops considered during training. This limitation highlights the relevance of future work towards the development of deep learning approaches capable of automatically learning the temporal vegetation dynamics for accurate crop disambiguation",

Nevertheless, due to the lack of dynamic information provided by isolated frames, the performance is hampered when the person is obscured or variable motion details are missed in isolated frames. To overcome this, we propose a novel Text-to-Video Person Retrieval (TVPR) task. Since there is no dataset or benchmark that describes person videos with natural language, we construct a large-scale cross-modal person video dataset containing detailed natural language annotations, termed as Text-to-Video Person Re-identification (TVPReid) dataset. In this paper, we introduce a Multielement Feature Guided Fragments Learning (MFGF) strategy, which leverages the cross-modal text-video representations to provide strong text-visual and text-motion matching information to tackle uncertain occlusion conflicting and variable motion details. Specifically, we establish two potential cross-modal spaces for text and video feature collaborative learning to progressively reduce the semantic difference between text and video. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed MFGF, extensive experiments have been conducted on TVPReid dataset. To the best of our knowledge, MFGF is the first successful attempt to use video for text-based person retrieval task and has achieved state-of-the-art performance on TVPReid dataset. The TVPReid dataset will be publicly available to benefit future research.",

Building on the success of powerful image-level vision-language (ViL) foundation models like CLIP, recent efforts have sought to harness their capabilities by either training a contrastive model from scratch with an extensive collection of region-label pairs or aligning the outputs of a detection model with image-level representations of region proposals. Despite notable progress, these approaches are plagued by computationally intensive training requirements, susceptibility to data noise, and deficiency in contextual information. To address these limitations, we explore the synergistic potential of off-the-shelf foundation models, leveraging their respective strengths in localization and semantics. We introduce a novel, generic, and efficient architecture, named RegionSpot, designed to integrate position-aware localization knowledge from a localization foundation model (e.g., SAM) with semantic information from a ViL model (e.g., CLIP). To fully exploit pretrained knowledge while minimizing training overhead, we keep both foundation models frozen, focusing optimization efforts solely on a lightweight attention-based knowledge integration module. Extensive experiments in open-world object recognition show that our RegionSpot achieves significant performance gain over prior alternatives, along with substantial computational savings (e.g., training our model with 3 million data in a single day using 8 V100 GPUs). RegionSpot outperforms GLIP-L by 2.9 in mAP on LVIS val set, with an even larger margin of 13.1 AP for more challenging and rare categories, and a 2.5 AP increase on ODinW.

Existing methods mainly focus on directly establishing the correspondence between two models and then aggregating point-wise distance between corresponding points, resulting in them being either inefficient or ineffective. In this paper, we propose DirDist, an efficient, effective, robust, and differentiable distance metric for 3D geometry data. Specifically, we construct DirDist based on the proposed implicit representation of 3D models, namely directional distance field (DDF), which defines the directional distances of 3D points to a model to capture its local surface geometry. We then transfer the discrepancy between two 3D geometric models as the discrepancy between their DDFs defined on an identical domain, naturally establishing model correspondence. To demonstrate the advantage of our DirDist, we explore various distance metric-driven 3D geometric modeling tasks, including template surface fitting, rigid registration, non-rigid registration, scene flow estimation and human pose optimization.

Therefore, we propose an innovative relational representation learning idea that simultaneously focuses on sufficiently mining the intrinsic features of individual image patches and the relations between image patch features. Based on this, we construct a Relational Representation Learning Network (RRL-Net). Specifically, we innovatively construct an autoencoder to fully characterize the individual intrinsic features, and introduce a feature interaction learning (FIL) module to extract deep-level feature relations. To further fully mine individual intrinsic features, a lightweight multi-dimensional global-to-local attention (MGLA) module is constructed to enhance the global feature extraction of individual image patches and capture local dependencies within global features. By combining the MGLA module, we further explore the feature extraction network and construct an attention-based lightweight feature extraction (ALFE) network. In addition, we propose a multi-loss post-pruning (MLPP) optimization strategy, which greatly promotes network optimization while avoiding increases in parameters and inference time.

To this end, we proposed O2V-mapping, which utilizes voxel-based language and geometric features to create an open-vocabulary field, thus allowing for local updates during online training process. Additionally, we leverage a foundational model for image segmentation to extract language features on object-level entities, achieving clear segmentation boundaries and hierarchical semantic features. For the purpose of preserving consistency in 3D object properties across different viewpoints, we propose a spatial adaptive voxel adjustment mechanism and a multi-view weight selection method.

The disregard of these differences is especially detrimental to social human-robot interaction, whereby robots commonly emulate human gaze based on heuristics or predefined patterns. However, human gaze patterns are heterogeneous and varying behaviors can significantly affect the outcomes of such human-robot interactions. To fill this gap, we developed a deep learning-based social cue integration model for saliency prediction to instead predict scanpaths in videos. Our model learned scanpaths by recursively integrating fixation history and social cues through a gating mechanism and sequential attention. We evaluated our approach on gaze datasets of dynamic social scenes, observed under the free-viewing condition. The introduction of fixation history into our models makes it possible to train a single unified model rather than the resource-intensive approach of training individual models for each set of scanpaths. We observed that the late neural integration approach surpasses early fusion when training models on a large dataset, in comparison to a smaller dataset with a similar distribution. Results also indicate that a single unified model, trained on all the observers' scanpaths, performs on par or better than individually trained models. We hypothesize that this outcome is a result of the group saliency representations instilling universal attention in the model, while the supervisory signal and fixation history guide it to learn personalized attentional behaviors, providing the unified model a benefit over individual models due to its implicit representation of universal attention.",

To alleviate these problems, this paper presents FIRM, a novel framework for Flexible Interactive image Reflection reMoval with various forms of guidance, where users can provide sparse visual guidance (e.g., points, boxes, or strokes) or text descriptions for better reflection removal.

The contrastive masks provide explicit cues for identifying reflection and transmission layers in blended images. Secondly, we devise a contrastive mask-guided reflection removal network that comprises a newly proposed contrastive guidance interaction block (CGIB). This block leverages a unique cross-attention mechanism that merges contrastive masks with image features, allowing for precise layer separation.

Typically, Adaptive Density Control (ADC) algorithm is adopted, leveraging view-averaged gradient magnitude thresholding for point densification, opacity thresholding for pruning, and regular all-points opacity reset. We reveal that this strategy is limited in tackling intricate/special image regions (e.g., transparent) due to inability of identifying all 3D zones requiring point densification, and lacking an appropriate mechanism to handle ill-conditioned points with negative impacts (e.g., occlusion due to false high opacity). To address these limitations, we propose a Localized Point Management (LPM) strategy, capable of identifying those error-contributing zones in greatest need for both point addition and geometry calibration. Zone identification is achieved by leveraging the underlying multiview geometry constraints, subject to image rendering errors. We apply point densification in the identified zones and then reset the opacity of the points in front of these regions, creating a new opportunity to correct poorly conditioned points. Serving as a versatile plugin, LPM can be seamlessly integrated into existing static 3D and dynamic 4D Gaussian Splatting models with minimal additional cost. Experimental evaluations validate the efficacy of our LPM in boosting a variety of existing 3D/4D models both quantitatively and qualitatively.

This challenge resonates profoundly in the domain of geoscience and remote sensing, where high-fidelity detection of tiny objects can facilitate a myriad of applications ranging from urban planning to environmental monitoring. In this paper, we propose a new framework, namely, DeNoising FPN with Trans R-CNN (DNTR), to improve the performance of tiny object detection. DNTR consists of an easy plug-in design, DeNoising FPN (DN-FPN), and an effective Transformer-based detector, Trans R-CNN. Specifically, feature fusion in the feature pyramid network is important for detecting multiscale objects. However, noisy features may be produced during the fusion process since there is no regularization between the features of different scales. Therefore, we introduce a DN-FPN module that utilizes contrastive learning to suppress noise in each level's features in the top-down path of FPN. Second, based on the two-stage framework, we replace the obsolete R-CNN detector with a novel Trans R-CNN detector to focus on the representation of tiny objects with self-attention.

Sparse-DeRF successfully regularizes the complicated joint optimization, presenting alleviated overfitting artifacts and enhanced quality on radiance fields. The regularization consists of three key components: Surface smoothness, helps the model accurately predict the scene structure utilizing unseen and additional hidden rays derived from the blur kernel based on statistical tendencies of real-world; Modulated gradient scaling, helps the model adjust the amount of the backpropagated gradient according to the arrangements of scene objects; Perceptual distillation improves the perceptual quality by overcoming the ill-posed multi-view inconsistency of image deblurring and distilling the pre-deblurred information, compensating for the lack of clean information in blurry images.

With a novel architecture and sampling procedure, we enable training on a mixture of 3D (with camera pose), 4D (pose+time) and video (time but no pose) data, which greatly improves generalization to unseen images and camera pose trajectories over prior works that focus on limited domains (e.g., object centric). 4DiM is the first-ever NVS method with intuitive metric-scale camera pose control enabled by our novel calibration pipeline for structure-from-motion-posed data. Experiments demonstrate that 4DiM outperforms prior 3D NVS models both in terms of image fidelity and pose alignment, while also enabling the generation of scene dynamics. 4DiM provides a general framework for a variety of tasks including single-image-to-3D, two-image-to-video (interpolation and extrapolation), and pose-conditioned video-to-video translation, which we illustrate qualitatively on a variety of scenes.

    "title": "Adaptive Mix for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation",
    "summary": "arXiv:2407.21586v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, blending two or more images to generate strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo supervision. Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined fixed rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones. The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency regularization. This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training? To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner. Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize. We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that the proposed frameworks can achieve superior performance. For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice similarity coefficient and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.",

However, conventional lesion segmentation models lack the flexibility to distinguish lesions according to specific requirements. Given the practical advantages of using text as guidance, we propose a novel model, Language-guided Scale-aware MedSegmentor (LSMS), which segments target lesions in medical images based on given textual expressions. We define this as a new task termed Referring Lesion Segmentation (RLS). To address the lack of suitable benchmarks for RLS, we construct a vision-language medical dataset named Reference Hepatic Lesion Segmentation (RefHL-Seg). LSMS incorporates two key designs: (i) Scale-Aware Vision-Language attention module, which performs visual feature extraction and vision-language alignment in parallel. By leveraging diverse convolutional kernels, this module acquires rich visual representations and interacts closely with linguistic features, thereby enhancing the model's capacity for precise object localization. (ii) Full-Scale Decoder, which globally models multi-modal features across multiple scales and captures complementary information between them to accurately delineate lesion boundaries. Additionally, we design a specialized loss function comprising both segmentation loss and vision-language contrastive loss to better optimize cross-modal learning. We validate the performance of LSMS on RLS as well as on conventional lesion segmentation tasks across multiple datasets. Our LSMS consistently achieves superior performance with significantly lower computational cost. Code and datasets will be released.",

However, existing methods usually append learnable prompt tokens solely with the category names to obtain textual features, which fails to fully leverage the rich context indicated in the category name. To address this issue, we propose the Tree of Attributes Prompt learning (TAP), which first instructs LLMs to generate a tree of attributes with a \"concept - attribute - description\" structure for each category, and then learn the hierarchy with vision and text prompt tokens. Unlike existing methods that merely augment category names with a set of unstructured descriptions, our approach essentially distills structured knowledge graphs associated with class names from LLMs. Furthermore, our approach introduces text and vision prompts designed to explicitly learn the corresponding visual attributes, effectively serving as domain experts. Additionally, the general and diverse descriptions generated based on the class names may be wrong or absent in the specific given images. To address this misalignment, we further introduce a vision-conditional pooling module to extract instance-specific text features.

However, their real-world deployment is often constrained by high latency during inference due to the substantial compute required by the LLM to process the large number of input tokens, predominantly arising from the image. To reduce inference costs, one can either downsize the LLM or reduce the number of input tokens needed to represent the image, the latter of which has been the focus of many recent efforts around token compression. However, it is unclear what the optimal trade-off is given a fixed inference budget. We first characterize this optimal trade-off between the number of visual tokens and LLM parameters by establishing scaling laws that capture variations in performance with these two factors. Our results reveal a surprising trend: for visual reasoning tasks, the inference-optimal behavior in VLMs is achieved by using the largest LLM that fits within the inference budget while minimizing visual token count - often to a single token. While the token reduction literature has mainly focused on maintaining base model performance by modestly reducing the token count (e.g., $5-10\\times$), our results indicate that the compute-optimal inference regime requires operating under even higher token compression ratios. Based on these insights, we take the first steps toward designing token compression algorithms tailored for high-compression settings, utilizing prompt-based compression of tokens. Our work underscores the performance and efficiency benefits of operating in low visual token regimes and the importance of developing tailored token reduction algorithms for such conditions.

First, we demonstrate that a Real-Time DEtection TRansformer, or RT-DETR, a state-of-the-art natural image detector, trained on a simple image-like representation of the EBC data achieves performance comparable to specialized EBC methods. Next, as part of our framework, we develop an efficient adaptation technique that transforms image-based detectors into event-based detection models by modifying their frozen latent representation space through minimal architectural additions. The resulting EvRT-DETR model reaches state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmark datasets Gen1 (mAP $+2.3$) and 1Mpx/Gen4 (mAP $+1.4$). These results demonstrate a fundamentally new approach to EBC object detection through principled adaptation of mainstream architectures, offering an efficient alternative with potential applications to other temporal visual domains.

    "title": "Assessing and Learning Alignment of Unimodal Vision and Language Models",
    "summary": "arXiv:2412.04616v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: How well are unimodal vision and language models aligned? Although prior work have approached answering this question, their assessment methods do not directly translate to how these models are used in practical vision-language tasks. In this paper, we propose a direct assessment method, inspired by linear probing, to assess vision-language alignment. We identify that the degree of alignment of the SSL vision models depends on their SSL training objective, and we find that the clustering quality of SSL representations has a stronger impact on alignment performance than their linear separability. Next, we introduce Swift Alignment of Image and Language (SAIL), a efficient transfer learning framework that aligns pretrained unimodal vision and language models for downstream vision-language tasks. Since SAIL leverages the strengths of pretrained unimodal models, it requires significantly fewer (6%) paired image-text data for the multimodal alignment compared to models like CLIP which are trained from scratch. SAIL training only requires a single A100 GPU, 5 hours of training and can accommodate a batch size up to 32,768. SAIL achieves 73.4% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet (vs. CLIP's 72.7%) and excels in zero-shot retrieval, complex reasoning, and semantic segmentation. Additionally, SAIL improves the language-compatibility of vision encoders that in turn enhance the performance of multimodal large language models.

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types. We conduct robust and thorough evaluation of 3D spatial reasoning capabilities by balancing the data distribution and adopting a novel FlipEval strategy. To further study the robustness of 3D spatial reasoning w.r.t. camera 3D viewpoints, our 3DSRBench includes two subsets with 3D spatial reasoning questions on paired images with common and uncommon viewpoints. We benchmark a wide range of open-sourced and proprietary LMMs, uncovering their limitations in various aspects of 3D awareness, such as height, orientation, location, and multi-object reasoning, as well as their degraded performance on images with uncommon camera viewpoints. Our 3DSRBench provide valuable findings and insights about the future development of LMMs with strong 3D reasoning capabilities.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12892v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Edge labels are typically at various granularity levels owing to the varying preferences of annotators, thus handling the subjectivity of per-pixel labels has been a focal point for edge detection. Previous methods often employ a simple voting strategy to diminish such label uncertainty or impose a strong assumption of labels with a pre-defined distribution, e.g., Gaussian. In this work, we unveil that the segment anything model (SAM) provides strong prior knowledge to model the uncertainty in edge labels. Our key insight is that the intermediate SAM features inherently correspond to object edges at various granularities, which reflects different edge options due to uncertainty. Therefore, we attempt to align uncertainty with granularity by regressing intermediate SAM features from different layers to object edges at multi-granularity levels. In doing so, the model can fully and explicitly explore diverse ``uncertainties'' in a data-driven fashion. Specifically, we inject a lightweight module (~ 1.5% additional parameters) into the frozen SAM to progressively fuse and adapt its intermediate features to estimate edges from coarse to fine. It is crucial to normalize the granularity level of human edge labels to match their innate uncertainty. For this, we simply perform linear blending to the real edge labels at hand to create pseudo labels with varying granularities. Consequently, our uncertainty-aligned edge detector can flexibly produce edges at any desired granularity (including an optimal one). Thanks to SAM, our model uniquely demonstrates strong generalizability for cross-dataset edge detection. Extensive experimental results on BSDS500, Muticue and NYUDv2 validate our model's superiority.",

Following the principle of Affordance, we define the affordance-aware object insertion task, which aims to seamlessly insert any object into any scene with various position prompts. To address the limited data issue and incorporate this task, we constructed the SAM-FB dataset, which contains over 3 million examples across more than 3,000 object categories. Furthermore, we propose the Mask-Aware Dual Diffusion (MADD) model, which utilizes a dual-stream architecture to simultaneously denoise the RGB image and the insertion mask. By explicitly modeling the insertion mask in the diffusion process, MADD effectively facilitates the notion of affordance.

Many applications in AD systems necessitate high-quality training datasets using both existing datasets and newly collected data. In this paper, we propose a traffic scene joint active learning (TSceneJAL) framework that can efficiently sample the balanced, diverse, and complex traffic scenes from both labeled and unlabeled data. The novelty of this framework is threefold: 1) a scene sampling scheme based on a category entropy, to identify scenes containing multiple object classes, thus mitigating class imbalance for the active learner; 2) a similarity sampling scheme, estimated through the directed graph representation and a marginalize kernel algorithm, to pick sparse and diverse scenes; 3) an uncertainty sampling scheme, predicted by a mixture density network, to select instances with the most unclear or complex regression outcomes for the learner. Finally, the integration of these three schemes in a joint selection strategy yields an optimal and valuable subdataset.

To address these challenges, we propose a General and Efficient Adapter (GE-Adapter) that integrates temporal-spatial and semantic consistency with Baliteral DDIM inversion. This framework introduces three key components: (1) Frame-based Temporal Consistency Blocks (FTC Blocks) to capture frame-specific features and enforce smooth inter-frame transitions via temporally-aware loss functions; (2) Channel-dependent Spatial Consistency Blocks (SCD Blocks) employing bilateral filters to enhance spatial coherence by reducing noise and artifacts; and (3) Token-based Semantic Consistency Module (TSC Module) to maintain semantic alignment using shared prompt tokens and frame-specific tokens.

One of the primary tools for recording surgical procedures and conducting subsequent analyses, such as performance assessment, is through videos. However, these operative videos tend to be notably lengthy compared to other fields, spanning from thirty minutes to several hours, which poses a challenge for AI models to effectively learn from them. Despite this challenge, the foreseeable increase in the volume of such videos in the near future necessitates the development and implementation of innovative techniques to tackle this issue effectively. In this article, we propose a novel technique called Kinematics Adaptive Frame Recognition (KAFR) that can efficiently eliminate redundant frames to reduce dataset size and computation time while retaining useful frames to improve accuracy. Specifically, we compute the similarity between consecutive frames by tracking the movement of surgical tools. Our approach follows these steps: $i)$ Tracking phase: a YOLOv8 model is utilized to detect tools presented in the scene, $ii)$ Similarity phase: Similarities between consecutive frames are computed by estimating variation in the spatial positions and velocities of the tools, $iii$) Classification phase: An X3D CNN is trained to classify segmentation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by analyzing datasets obtained through retrospective reviews of cases at two referral centers.

While many vision tasks benefit from pre-trained feature backbones to improve generalizability, point tracking has primarily relied on simpler backbones trained from scratch on synthetic data, which may limit robustness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, point tracking requires temporal awareness to ensure coherence across frames, but using temporally-aware features is still underexplored. Most current methods often employ a two-stage process: an initial coarse prediction followed by a refinement stage to inject temporal information and correct errors from the coarse stage. These approach, however, is computationally expensive and potentially redundant if the feature backbone itself captures sufficient temporal information.\n  In this work, we introduce Chrono, a feature backbone specifically designed for point tracking with built-in temporal awareness. Leveraging pre-trained representations from self-supervised learner DINOv2 and enhanced with a temporal adapter, Chrono effectively captures long-term temporal context, enabling precise prediction even without the refinement stage. Experimental results demonstrate that Chrono achieves state-of-the-art performance in a refiner-free setting on the TAP-Vid-DAVIS and TAP-Vid-Kinetics datasets, among common feature backbones used in point tracking as well as DINOv2, with exceptional efficiency.

Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details.

Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality) re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative metric disruption loss.

These paradigms allow us to systematically vary the cognitive load and probe specific processing stages. Notably, the CA paradigm enables the evaluation of multi-image reasoning even in VLMs architecturally limited to single images and facilitates the isolation of reasoning capabilities from perceptual limitations by controlling the descriptive input.

Despite significant advancements in general Visual Question Answering (VQA), multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still exhibit substantial limitations when handling multi-task VQA scenarios. These limitations manifest through erroneous spatial localization and misinterpretation of medical images, which primarily arise from two fundamental issues: inadequate image-text alignment and insufficient medical knowledge in general-purpose MLLMs for specialized medical applications. To address these issues, we introduce the Cross-Modal Clinical Knowledge Distiller (ClinKD), an innovative framework designed to enhance image-text alignment and establish more effective medical knowledge adaptation mechanisms, which enables MLLMs to adapt to medical knowledge. Our extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the ClinKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Med-GRIT-270k dataset, a challenging medical benchmark containing fine-grained multi-task QA pairs.

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.12791v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Due to their event-driven and parameter-efficient effect, spiking neural networks (SNNs) show potential in tasks requiring real-time multi-sensor perception, such as autonomous driving. The spiking mechanism facilitates sparse encoding, enabling spatial and temporal data to be represented in a discrete manner. However, SNNs still lag behind artificial neural networks (ANNs) in terms of performance and computational efficiency. One major challenge in SNNs is the timestep-wise iterative update of neuronal states, which makes it difficult to achieve an optimal trade-off among accuracy, latency, and training cost. Although some methods perform well with shorter timesteps, few propose strategies to overcome such constraint effectively. Moreover, many recent SNN advancements rely on either optimizations tailored to specific architectures or a collection of specialized neuron-level strategies. While these approaches can enhance performance, they often lead to increased computational expense and restrict their application to particular architectures or modalities. This leaves room for further exploration of simple, universal, and structure-agnostic strategies that could offer broader applicability and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Activation-wise Membrane Potential Propagation (AMP2), a novel state update mechanism for spiking neurons. Inspired by skip connections in deep networks, AMP2 incorporates the membrane potential of neurons into network, eliminating the need for iterative updates. Our method achieves significant improvements across various 3D modalities, including 3D point clouds and event streams, boosting Spiking PointNet's accuracy on ModelNet40 from 87.36% to 89.74% and surpassing ANN PointNet in recognition accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset.",

Contrast enhancement is one of the crucial steps in any segmentation algorithm - the more so since the retinal images are related to medical diagnosis. Contrast enhancement is a vital step that not only intensifies the darkness of the blood vessels but also prevents minor capillaries from being disregarded during the process. This paper proposes a novel model that utilizes the linear blending of Fuzzy Contrast Enhancement (FCE) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance the retinal image for retinal vascular structure segmentation. The scheme is tested using the Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) dataset. The assertion was then evaluated through performance comparison among other methodologies which are Gray-scaling, Histogram Equalization (HE), FCE, and CLAHE. It was evident in this paper that the combination of FCE and CLAHE methods showed major improvement.

In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of depth normalization strategies in the context of pseudo-label distillation. Our study shows that, under recent distillation paradigms (e.g., shared-context distillation), normalization is not always necessary, as omitting it can help mitigate the impact of noisy supervision. Furthermore, rather than focusing solely on how depth information is represented, we propose Cross-Context Distillation, which integrates both global and local depth cues to enhance pseudo-label quality. We also introduce an assistant-guided distillation strategy that incorporates complementary depth priors from a diffusion-based teacher model, enhancing supervision diversity and robustness.

The necessity for fine-tuning significantly limits CLIP's adaptability to novel datasets and domains. This requirement mandates substantial time and computational resources for each new dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce simple yet effective training-free approaches, Single-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (SLAC) and Two-stage LMM Augmented CLIP (TLAC), that leverages powerful Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as Gemini, for image classification. The proposed methods leverages the capabilities of pre-trained LMMs, allowing for seamless adaptation to diverse datasets and domains without the need for additional training.

Extensive evaluations on two public ST datasets and multiple prompt sampling strategies simulating real-world scenarios demonstrate that PH2ST not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, but also shows strong potential for practical applications such as imputing missing spots, ST super-resolution, and local-to-global prediction, highlighting its value for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in biomedical contexts.",

To address this challenge, we present ICE, short for Intrinsic Concept Extraction, a novel framework that exclusively utilises a T2I model to automatically and systematically extract intrinsic concepts from a single image. ICE consists of two pivotal stages. In the first stage, ICE devises an automatic concept localization module to pinpoint relevant text-based concepts and their corresponding masks within the image. This critical stage streamlines concept initialization and provides precise guidance for subsequent analysis. The second stage delves deeper into each identified mask, decomposing the object-level concepts into intrinsic concepts and general concepts. This decomposition allows for a more granular and interpretable breakdown of visual elements.

Typically, immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects, maintain global texture consistency, and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However, previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses, and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end, we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image, named Scene4U. Specifically, Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then, we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information, generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation, followed by layered optimization, which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method, improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE, while also achieving the fastest training speed. Additionally, to demonstrate the robustness of Scene4U and allow users to experience immersive scenes from various landmarks, we build WorldVista3D dataset for 3D scene reconstruction, which contains panoramic images of globally renowned sites.

Furthermore, existing methods face difficulties in effectively modeling inter-view relationships and enhancing spatial feature learning. In this paper, we introduce the MultiSensor-Home dataset, a novel benchmark designed for comprehensive action recognition in home environments, and also propose the Multi-modal Multi-view Transformer-based Sensor Fusion (MultiTSF) method. The proposed MultiSensor-Home dataset features untrimmed videos captured by distributed sensors, providing high-resolution RGB and audio data along with detailed multi-view frame-level action labels. The proposed MultiTSF method leverages a Transformer-based fusion mechanism to dynamically model inter-view relationships. Furthermore, the proposed method integrates a human detection module to enhance spatial feature learning, guiding the model to prioritize frames with human activity to enhance action the recognition accuracy. Experiments on the proposed MultiSensor-Home and the existing MM-Office datasets demonstrate the superiority of MultiTSF over the state-of-the-art methods. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed method in advancing real-world multi-modal multi-view action recognition.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.04756v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Modeling and reproducing crowd behaviors are important in various domains including psychology, robotics, transport engineering and virtual environments. Conventional methods have focused on synthesizing momentary scenes, which have difficulty in replicating the continuous nature of real-world crowds. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for automatically generating continuous, realistic crowd trajectories with heterogeneous behaviors and interactions among individuals. We first design a crowd emitter model. To do this, we obtain spatial layouts from single input images, including a segmentation map, appearance map, population density map and population probability, prior to crowd generation. The emitter then continually places individuals on the timeline by assigning independent behavior characteristics such as agents' type, pace, and start/end positions using diffusion models. Next, our crowd simulator produces their long-term locomotions. To simulate diverse actions, it can augment their behaviors based on a Markov chain. As a result, our overall framework populates the scenes with heterogeneous crowd behaviors by alternating between the proposed emitter and simulator. Note that all the components in the proposed framework are user-controllable. Lastly, we propose a benchmark protocol to evaluate the realism and quality of the generated crowds in terms of the scene-level population dynamics and the individual-level trajectory accuracy. We demonstrate that our approach effectively models diverse crowd behavior patterns and generalizes well across different geographical environments.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.07392v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have enabled the generation of high-quality synthetic data that is applicable in a variety of domains, including face recognition. Here, state-of-the-art generative models typically rely on conditioning and fine-tuning of powerful pretrained diffusion models to facilitate the synthesis of realistic images of a desired identity. Yet, these models often do not consider the identity of subjects during training, leading to poor consistency between generated and intended identities. In contrast, methods that employ identity-based training objectives tend to overfit on various aspects of the identity, and in turn, lower the diversity of images that can be generated. To address these issues, we present in this paper a novel generative diffusion-based framework, called ID-Booth. ID-Booth consists of a denoising network responsible for data generation, a variational auto-encoder for mapping images to and from a lower-dimensional latent space and a text encoder that allows for prompt-based control over the generation procedure. The framework utilizes a novel triplet identity training objective and enables identity-consistent image generation while retaining the synthesis capabilities of pretrained diffusion models. Experiments with a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model and diverse prompts reveal that our method facilitates better intra-identity consistency and inter-identity separability than competing methods, while achieving higher image diversity. In turn, the produced data allows for effective augmentation of small-scale datasets and training of better-performing recognition models in a privacy-preserving manner.

To this end, we propose Text-Guided Unified Vision Encoding, incorporating textual information in vision encoding to achieve pixel-level integration. We further design Context-Aware Recursive Alignment Decoding that recursively aggregates visual features conditioned on textual context during decoding, enabling fine-grained, question-level semantic integration. To guide feature mapping and mitigate modality discrepancies, we develop Dual-Supervised Semantic Mapping Loss. Additionally, we construct a Synthesized Language-Driven Question-Answer (QA) dataset through a new data synthesis method, prioritizing high-quality QA pairs to optimize text-guided feature integration. Building on these foundations, we train FUSION at two scales-3B, 8B-and demonstrate that our full-modality integration approach significantly outperforms existing methods with only 630 vision tokens. Notably, FUSION 3B surpasses Cambrian-1 8B and Florence-VL 8B on most benchmarks. FUSION 3B continues to outperform Cambrian-1 8B even when limited to 300 vision tokens.

Traditional MIS control methods for UNet architectures like SD v1.5/SDXL fail to adapt to DiT-based models like FLUX and SD v3.5, which rely on integrated attention between image and text tokens rather than text-image cross-attention. To enhance MIS in DiT, we first analyze the mixed attention mechanism in DiT. Our token-wise and layer-wise analysis of attention maps reveals a hierarchical response structure: instance tokens dominate early layers, background tokens in middle layers, and attribute tokens in later layers. Building on this observation, we propose a training-free approach for enhancing MIS in DiT-based models with hierarchical and step-layer-wise attention specialty tuning (AST). AST amplifies key regions while suppressing irrelevant areas in distinct attention maps across layers and steps, guided by the hierarchical structure. This optimizes multimodal interactions by hierarchically decoupling the complex prompts with instance-based sketches. We evaluate our approach using upgraded sketch-based layouts for the T2I-CompBench and customized complex scenes. Both quantitative and qualitative results confirm our method enhances complex layout generation, ensuring precise instance placement and attribute representation in MIS.",

Existing methods face certain limitations in terms of both data and algorithm. For training data, most approaches rely on manual annotated preference data, either by directly fine-tuning the generators or by training reward models to provide training signals. However, the high annotation cost makes them difficult to scale up, the reward model consumes extra computation and cannot guarantee accuracy. From an algorithmic perspective, most methods neglect the value of text and only take the image feedback as a comparative signal, which is inefficient and sparse. To alleviate these drawbacks, we propose the InstructEngine framework. Regarding annotation cost, we first construct a taxonomy for text-to-image generation, then develop an automated data construction pipeline based on it. Leveraging advanced large multimodal models and human-defined rules, we generate 25K text-image preference pairs. Finally, we introduce cross-validation alignment method, which refines data efficiency by organizing semantically analogous samples into mutually comparable pairs. Evaluations on DrawBench demonstrate that InstructEngine improves SD v1.5 and SDXL's performance by 10.53% and 5.30%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, with ablation study confirming the benefits of InstructEngine's all components.

While recent NeRF-based approaches have shown promising results, most suffer from high computational costs, and some rely on carefully captured or pre-processed data--such as RAW sensor inputs or multi-exposure sequences--which severely limits their practicality. In contrast, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with competitive visual fidelity; however, existing 3DGS-based methods struggle with low-light sRGB inputs, resulting in unstable Gaussian initialization and ineffective noise suppression. To address these challenges, we propose LL-Gaussian, a novel framework for 3D reconstruction and enhancement from low-light sRGB images, enabling pseudo normal-light novel view synthesis. Our method introduces three key innovations: 1) an end-to-end Low-Light Gaussian Initialization Module (LLGIM) that leverages dense priors from learning-based MVS approach to generate high-quality initial point clouds; 2) a dual-branch Gaussian decomposition model that disentangles intrinsic scene properties (reflectance and illumination) from transient interference, enabling stable and interpretable optimization; 3) an unsupervised optimization strategy guided by both physical constrains and diffusion prior to jointly steer decomposition and enhancement. Additionally, we contribute a challenging dataset collected in extreme low-light environments and demonstrate the effectiveness of LL-Gaussian.

In recent years, researchers have focused on developing general-purpose IR models capable of handling diverse degradation types, thereby reducing the cost and complexity of model development. Current mainstream approaches are based on three architectural paradigms: CNNs, Transformers, and Mambas. CNNs excel in efficient inference, whereas Transformers and Mamba excel at capturing long-range dependencies and modeling global contexts. While each architecture has demonstrated success in specialized, single-task settings, limited efforts have been made to effectively integrate heterogeneous architectures to jointly address diverse IR challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose RestorMixer, an efficient and general-purpose IR model based on mixed-architecture fusion. RestorMixer adopts a three-stage encoder-decoder structure, where each stage is tailored to the resolution and feature characteristics of the input. In the initial high-resolution stage, CNN-based blocks are employed to rapidly extract shallow local features. In the subsequent stages, we integrate a refined multi-directional scanning Mamba module with a multi-scale window-based self-attention mechanism. This hierarchical and adaptive design enables the model to leverage the strengths of CNNs in local feature extraction, Mamba in global context modeling, and attention mechanisms in dynamic feature refinement.

Such universality typically requires joint training across multi-domain datasets to ensure effective generalization. However, monocular 3D object detection presents unique challenges in multi-domain training due to the scarcity of datasets annotated with accurate 3D ground-truth labels, especially beyond typical road-based autonomous driving contexts. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel weakly supervised framework leveraging pseudo-labels. Current pretrained models often struggle to accurately detect pedestrians in non-road environments due to inherent dataset biases. Unlike generalized image-based 2D object detection models, achieving similar generalization in monocular 3D detection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose GATE3D, a novel framework designed specifically for generalized monocular 3D object detection via weak supervision. GATE3D effectively bridges domain gaps by employing consistency losses between 2D and 3D predictions. Remarkably, our model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI benchmark as well as on an indoor-office dataset collected by us to evaluate the generalization capabilities of our framework. Our results demonstrate that GATE3D significantly accelerates learning from limited annotated data through effective pre-training strategies, highlighting substantial potential for broader impacts in robotics, augmented reality, and virtual reality applications.

Recent advancements in large multi-modal models, notably Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), have motivated researchers to incorporate CLIP into dual-stream-based VQA methods. This integration aims to harness the model's superior semantic understanding capabilities to replicate the object recognition and detail analysis in ventral stream, as well as spatial relationship analysis in dorsal stream. However, CLIP is originally designed for images and lacks the ability to capture temporal and motion information inherent in videos. To address the limitation, this paper propose a Decoupled Vision-Language Modeling with Text-Guided Adaptation for Blind Video Quality Assessment (DVLTA-VQA), which decouples CLIP's visual and textual components, and integrates them into different stages of the NR-VQA pipeline. Specifically, a Video-Based Temporal CLIP module is proposed to explicitly model temporal dynamics and enhance motion perception, aligning with the dorsal stream. Additionally, a Temporal Context Module is developed to refine inter-frame dependencies, further improving motion modeling. On the ventral stream side, a Basic Visual Feature Extraction Module is employed to strengthen detail analysis. Finally, a text-guided adaptive fusion strategy is proposed to enable dynamic weighting of features, facilitating more effective integration of spatial and temporal information.",

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{BR-Gen}, a large-scale dataset of 150,000 locally forged images with diverse scene-aware annotations, which are based on semantic calibration to ensure high-quality samples. BR-Gen is constructed through a fully automated Perception-Creation-Evaluation pipeline to ensure semantic coherence and visual realism.

NFA-ViT mines heterogeneous regions in images, \\emph{i.e.}, potential edited areas, by noise fingerprints. Subsequently, attention mechanism is introduced to compel the interaction between normal and abnormal features, thereby propagating the generalization traces throughout the entire image, allowing subtle forgeries to influence a broader context and improving overall detection robustness.

    "title": "Event Quality Score (EQS): Assessing the Realism of Simulated Event Camera Streams via Distances in Latent Space",
    "summary": "arXiv:2504.12515v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Event cameras promise a paradigm shift in vision sensing with their low latency, high dynamic range, and asynchronous nature of events. Unfortunately, the scarcity of high-quality labeled datasets hinders their widespread adoption in deep learning-driven computer vision. To mitigate this, several simulators have been proposed to generate synthetic event data for training models for detection and estimation tasks. However, the fundamentally different sensor design of event cameras compared to traditional frame-based cameras poses a challenge for accurate simulation. As a result, most simulated data fail to mimic data captured by real event cameras. Inspired by existing work on using deep features for image comparison, we introduce event quality score (EQS), a quality metric that utilizes activations of the RVT architecture. Through sim-to-real experiments on the DSEC driving dataset, it is shown that a higher EQS implies improved generalization to real-world data after training on simulated events. Thus, optimizing for EQS can lead to developing more realistic event camera simulators, effectively reducing the simulation gap. EQS is available at https://github.com/eventbasedvision/EQS.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.12542v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Timely and accurate detection of hurricane debris is critical for effective disaster response and community resilience. While post-disaster aerial imagery is readily available, robust debris segmentation solutions applicable across multiple disaster regions remain limited. Developing a generalized solution is challenging due to varying environmental and imaging conditions that alter debris' visual signatures across different regions, further compounded by the scarcity of training data. This study addresses these challenges by fine-tuning pre-trained foundational vision models, achieving robust performance with a relatively small, high-quality dataset. Specifically, this work introduces an open-source dataset comprising approximately 1,200 manually annotated aerial RGB images from Hurricanes Ian, Ida, and Ike. To mitigate human biases and enhance data quality, labels from multiple annotators are strategically aggregated and visual prompt engineering is employed. The resulting fine-tuned model, named fCLIPSeg, achieves a Dice score of 0.70 on data from Hurricane Ida -- a disaster event entirely excluded during training -- with virtually no false positives in debris-free areas. This work presents the first event-agnostic debris segmentation model requiring only standard RGB imagery during deployment, making it well-suited for rapid, large-scale post-disaster impact assessments and recovery planning.",

The FramePack compresses input frames to make the transformer context length a fixed number regardless of the video length. As a result, we are able to process a large number of frames using video diffusion with computation bottleneck similar to image diffusion. This also makes the training video batch sizes significantly higher (batch sizes become comparable to image diffusion training). We also propose an anti-drifting sampling method that generates frames in inverted temporal order with early-established endpoints to avoid exposure bias (error accumulation over iterations). Finally, we show that existing video diffusion models can be finetuned with FramePack, and their visual quality may be improved because the next-frame prediction supports more balanced diffusion schedulers with less extreme flow shift timesteps.",

These intertwined limitations hinder realistic long-form synthesis and professional film-style generation. To address these limitations, we propose SkyReels-V2, an Infinite-length Film Generative Model, that synergizes Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), Multi-stage Pretraining, Reinforcement Learning, and Diffusion Forcing Framework. Firstly, we design a comprehensive structural representation of video that combines the general descriptions by the Multi-modal LLM and the detailed shot language by sub-expert models. Aided with human annotation, we then train a unified Video Captioner, named SkyCaptioner-V1, to efficiently label the video data. Secondly, we establish progressive-resolution pretraining for the fundamental video generation, followed by a four-stage post-training enhancement: Initial concept-balanced Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) improves baseline quality; Motion-specific Reinforcement Learning (RL) training with human-annotated and synthetic distortion data addresses dynamic artifacts; Our diffusion forcing framework with non-decreasing noise schedules enables long-video synthesis in an efficient search space; Final high-quality SFT refines visual fidelity.

A key challenge in image restoration is the lack of high-quality, paired-label images required for training supervised models. In this paper, we introduce the Circular Quasi-Conformal Deturbulence (CQCD) framework, an unsupervised approach for removing image distortions through a circular architecture. This design ensures that the restored image remains both geometrically accurate and visually faithful while preventing the accumulation of incorrect estimations. The circular restoration process involves both forward and inverse mapping. To ensure the bijectivity of the estimated non-rigid deformations, computational quasi-conformal geometry theories are leveraged to regularize the mapping, enforcing its homeomorphic properties. This guarantees a well-defined transformation that preserves structural integrity and prevents unwanted artifacts. Furthermore, tight-frame blocks are integrated to encode distortion-sensitive features for precise recovery. To validate the performance of our approach, we conduct evaluations on various synthetic and real-world captured images. Experimental results demonstrate that CQCD not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art deturbulence methods in terms of image restoration quality but also provides highly accurate deformation field estimations.",

We introduce two new benchmarks, TextVQA-C and GQA-C, to systematically evaluate how corruptions affect scene text understanding and object-based reasoning, respectively. Our analysis reveals that transformer-based VLMs exhibit distinct vulnerability patterns across tasks: text recognition deteriorates most severely under blur and snow corruptions, while object reasoning shows higher sensitivity to corruptions such as frost and impulse noise. We connect these observations to the frequency-domain characteristics of different corruptions, revealing how transformers' inherent bias toward low-frequency processing explains their differential robustness patterns.

However, higher order neurons have significantly greater learning capabilities since the decision boundaries of higher order neurons can be complex surfaces instead of just hyperplanes. The boundary of a single quadratic neuron can be a general hyper-quadric surface allowing it to learn many nonlinearly separable datasets. Since quadratic forms can be represented by symmetric matrices, only $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ additional parameters are needed instead of $n^2$. A quadratic Logistic regression model is first presented. Solutions to the XOR problem with a single quadratic neuron are considered. The complete vectorized equations for both forward and backward propagation in feedforward networks composed of quadratic neurons are derived. A reduced parameter quadratic neural network model with just $ n $ additional parameters per neuron that provides a compromise between learning ability and computational cost is presented. Comparison on benchmark classification datasets are used to demonstrate that a final layer of quadratic neurons enables networks to achieve higher accuracy with significantly fewer hidden layer neurons. In particular this paper shows that any dataset composed of $\\mathcal{C}$ bounded clusters can be separated with only a single layer of $\\mathcal{C}$ quadratic neurons.",

In contrast, both camera RAW and high dynamic range (HDR) images are often represented in linear color spaces, in which color values are linearly related to colorimetric quantities of light. While training on commonly available display-encoded images is a well-established practice, there is no consensus on how neural networks should be trained for tasks on RAW and HDR images in linear color spaces. In this work, we test several approaches on three popular image restoration applications: denoising, deblurring, and single-image super-resolution. We examine whether HDR/RAW images need to be display-encoded using popular transfer functions (PQ, PU21, and mu-law), or whether it is better to train in linear color spaces, but use loss functions that correct for perceptual non-uniformity. Our results indicate that neural networks train significantly better on HDR and RAW images represented in display-encoded color spaces, which offer better perceptual uniformity than linear spaces. This small change to the training strategy can bring a very substantial gain in performance, between 2 and 9 dB.",

To mitigate this, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) strategies, such as LoRA, have been developed. In this paper, we delve into the concept of task-specific directions (TSDs), which are critical for transitioning large models from pretrained states to task-specific enhancements in PEFT. We propose a framework to clearly define these directions and explore their properties and practical utilization challenges. We then introduce a novel approach, LoRA-Dash, which aims to maximize the impact of TSDs during the fine-tuning process, thereby enhancing model performance on targeted tasks. Additionally, based on our exploration of TSD, we focus on an important issue in PEFT: the initialization of LoRA. While some works have pointed out the significance of initialization for LoRA's performance and proposed various strategies, these methods are often empirical and not task-specific. To address this issue, we propose LoRA-Init. Starting from TSD, we identify the directions that require the most adjustment during fine-tuning for downstream tasks. By initializing the matrices in LoRA with these directions, LoRA-Init significantly enhances LoRA's performance. Moreover, we can combine LoRA-Dash and LoRA-Init to create the final version of LoRA based on TSDs, which we refer to as LoRA-TSD.

This paper, for the first time, explores the feasibility of adversarial attacking various downstream models fine-tuned from the segment anything model (SAM), by solely utilizing the information from the open-sourced SAM. In contrast to prevailing transfer-based adversarial attacks, we demonstrate the existence of adversarial dangers even without accessing the downstream task and dataset to train a similar surrogate model. To enhance the effectiveness of the adversarial attack towards models fine-tuned on unknown datasets, we propose a universal meta-initialization (UMI) algorithm to extract the intrinsic vulnerability inherent in the foundation model, which is then utilized as the prior knowledge to guide the generation of adversarial perturbations. Moreover, by formulating the gradient difference in the attacking process between the open-sourced SAM and its fine-tuned downstream models, we theoretically demonstrate that a deviation occurs in the adversarial update direction by directly maximizing the distance of encoded feature embeddings in the open-sourced SAM. Consequently, we propose a gradient robust loss that simulates the associated uncertainty with gradient-based noise augmentation to enhance the robustness of generated adversarial examples (AEs) towards this deviation, thus improving the transferability.

Both uncertainty and explainability are important for safety-critical applications such as surgical interventions. We demonstrate LUDO's abilities for autonomous targeting of internal regions of interest (ROIs) in deformable objects. %Additionally, LUDO provides uncertainty estimates and explainability for its predictions, both of which are important in safety-critical applications such as surgical interventions. We evaluate LUDO in real-world robotic experiments, achieving a success rate of 98.9% for puncturing various ROIs inside deformable objects. LUDO demonstrates the potential to interact with deformable objects without the need for deformable registration methods.",

    "title": "Robust multi-coil MRI reconstruction via self-supervised denoising",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: To examine the effect of incorporating self-supervised denoising as a pre-processing step for training deep learning (DL) based reconstruction methods on data corrupted by Gaussian noise. K-space data employed for training are typically multi-coil and inherently noisy. Although DL-based reconstruction methods trained on fully sampled data can enable high reconstruction quality, obtaining large, noise-free datasets is impractical. We leverage Generalized Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (GSURE) for denoising. We evaluate two DL-based reconstruction methods: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) and Model-Based Deep Learning (MoDL). We evaluate the impact of denoising on the performance of these DL-based methods in solving accelerated multi-coil magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. The experiments were carried out on T2-weighted brain and fat-suppressed proton-density knee scans. We observed that self-supervised denoising enhances the quality and efficiency of MRI reconstructions across various scenarios. Specifically, employing denoised images rather than noisy counterparts when training DL networks results in lower normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE), higher structural similarity index measure (SSIM) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) across different SNR levels, including 32dB, 22dB, and 12dB for T2-weighted brain data, and 24dB, 14dB, and 4dB for fat-suppressed knee data. Overall, we showed that denoising is an essential pre-processing technique capable of improving the efficacy of DL-based MRI reconstruction methods under diverse conditions. By refining the quality of input data, denoising enables training more effective DL networks, potentially bypassing the need for noise-free reference MRI scans.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion (HMIF) aims to fuse low-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSIs) and high-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSIs) to reconstruct high spatial and high spectral resolution images. Current methods typically apply direct fusion from the two modalities without effective supervision, leading to an incomplete perception of deep modality-complementary information and a limited understanding of inter-modality correlations. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective solution for unsupervised HMIF, revealing that modality decoupling is key to improving fusion performance. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end self-supervised \\textbf{Mo}dality-Decoupled \\textbf{S}patial-\\textbf{S}pectral Fusion (\\textbf{MossFuse}) framework that decouples shared and complementary information across modalities and aggregates a concise representation of both LR-HSIs and HR-MSIs to reduce modality redundancy. Also, we introduce the subspace clustering loss as a clear guide to decouple modality-shared features from modality-complementary ones. Systematic experiments over multiple datasets demonstrate that our simple and effective approach consistently outperforms the existing HMIF methods while requiring considerably fewer parameters with reduced inference time.

    "summary": "arXiv:2501.15572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence systems. This study introduces CRF-GAN, a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture that enhances structural consistency in 3D medical image synthesis. Integrating Conditional Random Fields within a two-step generation process allows CRF-GAN improving spatial coherence while maintaining high-resolution image quality. The model's performance is evaluated against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: We evaluate the performance of CRF-GAN against the HA-GAN model. The comparison between the two models was made through a quantitative evaluation, using FID and MMD metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID and MMD scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. The key objective was not only to lower the computational cost but also to reallocate the freed-up resources towards the creation of higher-resolution 3D imaging, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability. Moreover, unlike many previous studies, we combined qualitative and quantitative assessments to obtain a more holistic feedback on the model's performance.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.01776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

However, the generated videos often contain factual inaccuracies and lack understanding of fundamental physical laws. While some previous studies have highlighted this issue in limited domains through manual analysis, a comprehensive solution has not yet been established, primarily due to the absence of a generalized, automated approach for modeling and assessing the causal reasoning of these models across diverse scenarios. To address this gap, we propose VACT: an **automated** framework for modeling, evaluating, and measuring the causal understanding of VGMs in real-world scenarios. By combining causal analysis techniques with a carefully designed large language model assistant, our system can assess the causal behavior of models in various contexts without human annotation, which offers strong generalization and scalability. Additionally, we introduce multi-level causal evaluation metrics to provide a detailed analysis of the causal performance of VGMs. As a demonstration, we use our framework to benchmark several prevailing VGMs, offering insight into their causal reasoning capabilities. Our work lays the foundation for systematically addressing the causal understanding deficiencies in VGMs and contributes to advancing their reliability and real-world applicability.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.17211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Real-world machine learning applications often struggle with two major challenges: distribution shift and label noise. Models tend to overfit by focusing on redundant and uninformative features in the training data, which makes it hard for them to generalize to the target domain. Noisy data worsens this problem by causing further overfitting to the noise, meaning that existing methods often fail to tell the difference between true, invariant features and misleading, spurious ones. To tackle these issues, we introduce Anchor Alignment and Adaptive Weighting (A3W). This new algorithm uses sample reweighting guided by natural language processing (NLP) anchors to extract more representative features. In simple terms, A3W leverages semantic representations from natural language models as a source of domain-invariant prior knowledge. Additionally, it employs a weighted loss function that adjusts each sample's contribution based on its similarity to the corresponding NLP anchor. This adjustment makes the model more robust to noisy labels. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets show that A3W consistently outperforms state-of-the-art domain generalization methods, offering significant improvements in both accuracy and robustness across different datasets and noise levels.",

Unfortunately, recent jailbreaking attack methods manually design prompts for the LLM to generate adversarial prompts, which effectively bypass safety filters while producing sensitive images, exposing safety vulnerabilities of T2I models. However, due to the LLM's limited understanding of the T2I model and its safety filters, existing methods require numerous queries to achieve a successful attack, limiting their practical applicability. To address this issue, we propose Reason2Attack(R2A), which aims to enhance the LLM's reasoning capabilities in generating adversarial prompts by incorporating the jailbreaking attack into the post-training process of the LLM. Specifically, we first propose a CoT example synthesis pipeline based on Frame Semantics, which generates adversarial prompts by identifying related terms and corresponding context illustrations. Using CoT examples generated by the pipeline, we fine-tune the LLM to understand the reasoning path and format the output structure. Subsequently, we incorporate the jailbreaking attack task into the reinforcement learning process of the LLM and design an attack process reward that considers prompt length, prompt stealthiness, and prompt effectiveness, aiming to further enhance reasoning accuracy. Extensive experiments on various T2I models show that R2A achieves a better attack success ratio while requiring fewer queries than baselines. Moreover, our adversarial prompts demonstrate strong attack transferability across both open-source and commercial T2I models.",

Specifically, we focus on synthesizing seismic velocity models conditioned on imaged seismic. Our method enables sensitivity analysis by sampling from intermediate power posteriors, allowing us to assess the relative influence of the prior and likelihood on samples of the posterior distribution. Through a comprehensive set of experiments, we evaluate the effects of varying the power parameter in different settings: applying it solely to the prior, to the likelihood of a Bayesian formulation, and to both simultaneously. The results show that increasing the power of the likelihood up to a certain threshold improves the fidelity of posterior samples to the conditioning data (e.g., seismic images), while decreasing the prior power promotes greater structural diversity among samples. Moreover, we find that moderate scaling of the likelihood leads to a reduced shot data residual, confirming its utility in posterior refinement.",

We propose StyleMe3D, a holistic framework for 3D GS style transfer that integrates multi-modal style conditioning, multi-level semantic alignment, and perceptual quality enhancement. Our key insights include: (1) optimizing only RGB attributes preserves geometric integrity during stylization; (2) disentangling low-, medium-, and high-level semantics is critical for coherent style transfer; (3) scalability across isolated objects and complex scenes is essential for practical deployment. StyleMe3D introduces four novel components: Dynamic Style Score Distillation (DSSD), leveraging Stable Diffusion's latent space for semantic alignment; Contrastive Style Descriptor (CSD) for localized, content-aware texture transfer; Simultaneously Optimized Scale (SOS) to decouple style details and structural coherence; and 3D Gaussian Quality Assessment (3DG-QA), a differentiable aesthetic prior trained on human-rated data to suppress artifacts and enhance visual harmony. Evaluated on NeRF synthetic dataset (objects) and tandt db (scenes) datasets, StyleMe3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in preserving geometric details (e.g., carvings on sculptures) and ensuring stylistic consistency across scenes (e.g., coherent lighting in landscapes), while maintaining real-time rendering.

While recent MLLMs have shown impressive advances in high-level reasoning and planning, they frequently fall short when confronted with multi-view geometric consistency and cross-view correspondence. To comprehensively evaluate the challenges of MLLMs in multi-view scene reasoning, we propose All-Angles Bench, a benchmark of over 2,100 human carefully annotated multi-view question-answer pairs across 90 diverse real-world scenes. Our six tasks (counting, attribute identification, relative distance, relative direction, object manipulation, and camera pose estimation) specifically test model's geometric correspondence and the capacity to align information consistently across views. Our extensive experiments, benchmark on 27 representative MLLMs including Gemini-2.0-Flash, Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and GPT-4o against human evaluators reveals a substantial performance gap, indicating that current MLLMs remain far from human-level proficiency. Through in-depth analysis, we show that MLLMs are particularly underperforming under two aspects: (1) cross-view correspondence for partially occluded views and (2) establishing the coarse camera poses. These findings highlight the necessity of domain-specific refinements or modules that embed stronger multi-view awareness.

Compared with traditional reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or pairwise preference approaches such as direct preference optimization (DPO), DRAGON is more flexible. It can optimize reward functions that evaluate either individual examples or distributions of them, making it compatible with a broad spectrum of instance-wise, instance-to-distribution, and distribution-to-distribution rewards. Leveraging this versatility, we construct novel reward functions by selecting an encoder and a set of reference examples to create an exemplar distribution. When cross-modality encoders such as CLAP are used, the reference examples may be of a different modality (e.g., text versus audio). Then, DRAGON gathers online and on-policy generations, scores them to construct a positive demonstration set and a negative set, and leverages the contrast between the two sets to maximize the reward. For evaluation, we fine-tune an audio-domain text-to-music diffusion model with 20 different reward functions, including a custom music aesthetics model, CLAP score, Vendi diversity, and Frechet audio distance (FAD). We further compare instance-wise (per-song) and full-dataset FAD settings while ablating multiple FAD encoders and reference sets. Over all 20 target rewards, DRAGON achieves an 81.45% average win rate. Moreover, reward functions based on exemplar sets indeed enhance generations and are comparable to model-based rewards. With an appropriate exemplar set, DRAGON achieves a 60.95% human-voted music quality win rate without training on human preference annotations.

    "summary": "In this paper, we introduce EasyEdit2, a framework designed to enable plug-and-play adjustability for controlling Large Language Model (LLM) behaviors. EasyEdit2 supports a wide range of test-time interventions, including safety, sentiment, personality, reasoning patterns, factuality, and language features. Unlike its predecessor, EasyEdit2 features a new architecture specifically designed for seamless model steering. It comprises key modules such as the steering vector generator and the steering vector applier, which enable automatic generation and application of steering vectors to influence the model's behavior without modifying its parameters. One of the main advantages of EasyEdit2 is its ease of use-users do not need extensive technical knowledge. With just a single example, they can effectively guide and adjust the model's responses, making precise control both accessible and efficient. Empirically, we report model steering performance across different LLMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of these techniques. We have released the source code on GitHub at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit along with a demonstration notebook. In addition, we provide a demo video at https://zjunlp.github.io/project/EasyEdit2/video for a quick introduction.",

    "title": "RainbowPlus: Enhancing Adversarial Prompt Generation via Evolutionary Quality-Diversity Search",
    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities but are susceptible to adversarial prompts that exploit vulnerabilities to produce unsafe or biased outputs. Existing red-teaming methods often face scalability challenges, resource-intensive requirements, or limited diversity in attack strategies. We propose RainbowPlus, a novel red-teaming framework rooted in evolutionary computation, enhancing adversarial prompt generation through an adaptive quality-diversity (QD) search that extends classical evolutionary algorithms like MAP-Elites with innovations tailored for language models. By employing a multi-element archive to store diverse high-quality prompts and a comprehensive fitness function to evaluate multiple prompts concurrently, RainbowPlus overcomes the constraints of single-prompt archives and pairwise comparisons in prior QD methods like Rainbow Teaming. Experiments comparing RainbowPlus to QD methods across six benchmark datasets and four open-source LLMs demonstrate superior attack success rate (ASR) and diversity (Diverse-Score approx 0.84), generating up to 100 times more unique prompts (e.g., 10,418 vs. 100 for Ministral-8B-Instruct-2410). Against nine state-of-the-art methods on the HarmBench dataset with twelve LLMs (ten open-source, two closed-source), RainbowPlus achieves an average ASR of 81.1%, surpassing AutoDAN-Turbo by 3.9%, and is 9 times faster (1.45 vs. 13.50 hours). Our open-source implementation fosters further advancements in LLM safety, offering a scalable tool for vulnerability assessment.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning (RL) with simple rule-based rewards. However, existing zero-RL approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. We introduce LUFFY (Learning to reason Under oFF-policY guidance), a framework that augments zero-RL with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Notably, we propose policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Remarkably, LUFFY achieves an over +7.0 average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over +6.2 points in out-of-distribution tasks. It also substantially surpasses imitation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT), particularly in generalization. Analysis shows LUFFY not only imitates effectively but also explores beyond demonstrations, offering a scalable path to train generalizable reasoning models with off-policy guidance.",

    "summary": "Camera and human motion controls have been extensively studied for video generation, but existing approaches typically address them separately, suffering from limited data with high-quality annotations for both aspects. To overcome this, we present Uni3C, a unified 3D-enhanced framework for precise control of both camera and human motion in video generation. Uni3C includes two key contributions. First, we propose a plug-and-play control module trained with a frozen video generative backbone, PCDController, which utilizes unprojected point clouds from monocular depth to achieve accurate camera control. By leveraging the strong 3D priors of point clouds and the powerful capacities of video foundational models, PCDController shows impressive generalization, performing well regardless of whether the inference backbone is frozen or fine-tuned. This flexibility enables different modules of Uni3C to be trained in specific domains, i.e., either camera control or human motion control, reducing the dependency on jointly annotated data. Second, we propose a jointly aligned 3D world guidance for the inference phase that seamlessly integrates both scenic point clouds and SMPL-X characters to unify the control signals for camera and human motion, respectively. Extensive experiments confirm that PCDController enjoys strong robustness in driving camera motion for fine-tuned backbones of video generation. Uni3C substantially outperforms competitors in both camera controllability and human motion quality. Additionally, we collect tailored validation sets featuring challenging camera movements and human actions to validate the effectiveness of our method.",

    "summary": "Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) augments large language models (LLMs) with the ability to invoke external tools, such as search engines and code interpreters, to solve tasks beyond the capabilities of language-only reasoning. While reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in improving TIR by optimizing final answer correctness, existing approaches often overlook the efficiency and cost associated with tool usage. This can lead to suboptimal behavior, including excessive tool calls that increase computational and financial overhead, or insufficient tool use that compromises answer quality. In this work, we propose Optimal Tool Call-controlled Policy Optimization (OTC-PO), a simple yet effective RL-based framework that encourages models to produce accurate answers with minimal tool calls. Our method introduces a tool-integrated reward that jointly considers correctness and tool efficiency, promoting high tool productivity. We instantiate this framework within both Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Preference Optimization (GRPO), resulting in OTC-PPO and OTC-GRPO. Experiments with Qwen-2.5 and Qwen-Math across multiple QA benchmarks show that our approach reduces tool calls by up to 73.1\\% and improves tool productivity by up to 229.4\\%, while maintaining comparable answer accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first RL-based framework that explicitly optimizes tool-use efficiency in TIR.",

    "summary": "We introduce TAPIP3D, a novel approach for long-term 3D point tracking in monocular RGB and RGB-D videos. TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds, leveraging depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is effectively canceled. TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion estimates within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over extended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point distributions, we propose a Local Pair Attention mechanism. This 3D contextualization strategy effectively exploits spatial relationships in 3D, forming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation. Our 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking methods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D pixel trackers when accurate depth is available. It supports inference in both camera coordinates (i.e., unstabilized) and world coordinates, and our results demonstrate that compensating for camera motion improves tracking performance. Our approach replaces the conventional 2D square correlation neighborhoods used in prior 2D and 3D trackers, leading to more robust and accurate results across various 3D point tracking benchmarks.

A hybrid control detection pipeline fuses Windows UI Automation (UIA) with vision-based parsing to support diverse interface styles. Runtime efficiency is further enhanced through speculative multi-action planning, reducing per-step LLM overhead. Finally, a Picture-in-Picture (PiP) interface enables automation within an isolated virtual desktop, allowing agents and users to operate concurrently without interference.   We evaluate UFO2 across over 20 real-world Windows applications, demonstrating substantial improvements in robustness and execution accuracy over prior CUAs.

    "summary": "The increasing demand for AR/VR applications has highlighted the need for high-quality 360-degree panoramic content. However, generating high-quality 360-degree panoramic images and videos remains a challenging task due to the severe distortions introduced by equirectangular projection (ERP). Existing approaches either fine-tune pretrained diffusion models on limited ERP datasets or attempt tuning-free methods that still rely on ERP latent representations, leading to discontinuities near the poles. In this paper, we introduce SphereDiff, a novel approach for seamless 360-degree panoramic image and video generation using state-of-the-art diffusion models without additional tuning. We define a spherical latent representation that ensures uniform distribution across all perspectives, mitigating the distortions inherent in ERP. We extend MultiDiffusion to spherical latent space and propose a spherical latent sampling method to enable direct use of pretrained diffusion models. Moreover, we introduce distortion-aware weighted averaging to further improve the generation quality in the projection process. Our method outperforms existing approaches in generating 360-degree panoramic content while maintaining high fidelity, making it a robust solution for immersive AR/VR applications.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have powered Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, showing promise in automating tasks on computing devices. Recent works have begun exploring reasoning in GUI tasks with encouraging results. However, many current approaches rely on manually designed reasoning templates, which may result in reasoning that is not sufficiently robust and adaptive for complex GUI environments. Meanwhile, some existing agents continue to operate as Reactive Actors, relying primarily on implicit reasoning that may lack sufficient depth for GUI tasks demanding planning and error recovery. We argue that advancing these agents requires a shift from reactive acting towards acting based on deliberate reasoning. To facilitate this transformation, we introduce InfiGUI-R1, an MLLM-based GUI agent developed through our Actor2Reasoner framework, a reasoning-centric, two-stage training approach designed to progressively evolve agents from Reactive Actors to Deliberative Reasoners. The first stage, Reasoning Injection, focuses on establishing a basic reasoner. We employ Spatial Reasoning Distillation to transfer cross-modal spatial reasoning capabilities from teacher models to MLLMs through trajectories with explicit reasoning steps, enabling models to integrate GUI visual-spatial information with logical reasoning before action generation. The second stage, Deliberation Enhancement, refines the basic reasoner into a deliberative one using Reinforcement Learning. This stage introduces two approaches: Sub-goal Guidance, which rewards models for generating accurate intermediate sub-goals, and Error Recovery Scenario Construction, which creates failure-and-recovery training scenarios from identified prone-to-error steps. Experimental results show InfiGUI-R1 achieves strong performance in GUI grounding and trajectory tasks. Resources at https://github.com/Reallm-Labs/InfiGUI-R1.",

Traditional approaches using pre-training or fine-tuning with massive datasets struggle with the diversity of mobile applications and user-specific tasks. We propose enhancing mobile GUI agent capabilities through human demonstrations, focusing on improving performance in unseen scenarios rather than pursuing universal generalization through larger datasets. To realize this paradigm, we introduce LearnGUI, the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for studying demonstration-based learning in mobile GUI agents, comprising 2,252 offline tasks and 101 online tasks with high-quality human demonstrations. We further develop LearnAct, a sophisticated multi-agent framework that automatically extracts knowledge from demonstrations to enhance task completion.

A custom dataset was developed featuring both single-class (greenfruit) and multi-class (occluded and non-occluded greenfruits) annotations to assess model performance under dynamic real-world conditions. RF-DETR object detection model, utilizing a DINOv2 backbone and deformable attention, excelled in global context modeling, effectively identifying partially occluded or ambiguous greenfruits. In contrast, YOLOv12 leveraged CNN-based attention for enhanced local feature extraction, optimizing it for computational efficiency and edge deployment. RF-DETR achieved the highest mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.9464 in single-class detection, proving its superior ability to localize greenfruits in cluttered scenes. Although YOLOv12N recorded the highest mAP@50:95 of 0.7620, RF-DETR consistently outperformed in complex spatial scenarios. For multi-class detection, RF-DETR led with an mAP@50 of 0.8298, showing its capability to differentiate between occluded and non-occluded fruits, while YOLOv12L scored highest in mAP@50:95 with 0.6622, indicating better classification in detailed occlusion contexts. Training dynamics analysis highlighted RF-DETR's swift convergence, particularly in single-class settings where it plateaued within 10 epochs, demonstrating the efficiency of transformer-based architectures in adapting to dynamic visual data.

Recent advancements in reinforcement learning (RL), particularly with R1-like models, have demonstrated promising reasoning and generalization abilities. Yet, reward design for tool use presents unique challenges: multiple tools may be invoked with diverse parameters, and coarse-grained reward signals, such as answer matching, fail to offer the finegrained feedback required for effective learning. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on reward design for tool selection and application tasks within the RL paradigm.

Building on these insights, we propose a principled reward design tailored for tool use tasks and apply it to train LLMs using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach yields robust, scalable, and stable training, achieving a 17% improvement over base models and a 15% gain over SFT models.

NEMOTRON-CROSSTHINK addresses key challenges by (1) incorporating data from varied sources spanning STEM, humanities, social sciences, etc.; (2) applying structured templates (e.g., multiple-choice and open-ended) to control answer-space complexity; (3) filtering for verifiable answers; and (4) optimizing data blending strategies that utilizes data from multiple sources effectively. Our approach enables scalable and verifiable reward modeling beyond mathematics and demonstrates improved accuracies on both math (MATH-500: +30.1%, AMC23:+27.5%) and non-math reasoning benchmarks (MMLU-PRO: +12.8%, GPQA-DIAMOND: +11.3%, AGIEVAL: +15.1%, SUPERGPQA: +3.8%).

To address these challenges, we introduce an end-to-end speech-driven medical VLM, SilVar-Med, a multimodal medical image assistant that integrates speech interaction with VLMs, pioneering the task of voice-based communication for medical image analysis. In addition, we focus on the interpretation of the reasoning behind each prediction of medical abnormalities with a proposed reasoning dataset. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept study for reasoning-driven medical image interpretation with end-to-end speech interaction. We believe this work will advance the field of medical AI by fostering more transparent, interactive, and clinically viable diagnostic support systems. Our code and dataset are publicly available at SiVar-Med.",

    "title": "LookingGlass: Generative Anamorphoses via Laplacian Pyramid Warping",
    "summary": "Anamorphosis refers to a category of images that are intentionally distorted, making them unrecognizable when viewed directly. Their true form only reveals itself when seen from a specific viewpoint, which can be through some catadioptric device like a mirror or a lens. While the construction of these mathematical devices can be traced back to as early as the 17th century, they are only interpretable when viewed from a specific vantage point and tend to lose meaning when seen normally. In this paper, we revisit these famous optical illusions with a generative twist. With the help of latent rectified flow models, we propose a method to create anamorphic images that still retain a valid interpretation when viewed directly. To this end, we introduce Laplacian Pyramid Warping, a frequency-aware image warping technique key to generating high-quality visuals. Our work extends Visual Anagrams (arXiv:2311.17919) to latent space models and to a wider range of spatial transforms, enabling the creation of novel generative perceptual illusions.",
