    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23691v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present Game-TARS, a generalist game agent trained with a unified, scalable action space anchored to human-aligned native keyboard-mouse inputs. Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks. Scaling results on training-time and test-time confirm that the unified action space sustains improvements when scaled to cross-game and multimodal data. Our results demonstrate that simple, scalable action representations combined with large-scale pre-training provide a promising path toward generalist agents with broad computer-use abilities.",

Drawing on recent work in the philosophy of creativity, I distinguish between creative approaches and creative products, and introduce the concept of disciplinary creativity -the creative application of discipline-specific expertise to a valued problem within that field. Through two cases in mathematics, I show that while computation can extend disciplinary creativity, certain approaches involving AI can serve to displace it. This displacement has the potential to alter (and, perhaps, diminish) the value of scientific pursuit.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23744v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Multi-environment POMDPs (ME-POMDPs) extend standard POMDPs with discrete model uncertainty. ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance, when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set, i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs, and thus ME-POMDPs. We demonstrate that we can compute policies for standard POMDP benchmarks extended to the multi-environment setting.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23746v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning, enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap, enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively. Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23807v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In non-medical domains, foundation models (FMs) have revolutionized computer vision and language processing through large-scale self-supervised and multimodal learning. Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Long-horizon tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and dynamic re-planning remain challenging for large language models (LLMs). Sequential prompting methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii) structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under the strict pass@1 protocol.",

This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such systems.",

This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot.

To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers.

In real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science -- causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes, not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based, constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal discovery methods.",

Fitting a na\\\"ive probabilistic model to pairwise comparison data (say over prompt-completion pairs) yields an inconsistent estimate of the population-average utility -a canonical measure of social welfare. We propose a new method, dubbed the sign estimator, that provides a simple, provably consistent, and efficient estimator by replacing cross-entropy with binary classification loss in the aggregation step. This simple modification recovers consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular) estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23989v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First, measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g., sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions. This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in SIR.",

We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances.

Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "title": "From Observability Data to Diagnosis: An Evolving Multi-agent System for Incident Management in Cloud Systems",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24145v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper, we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop. Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Building training-ready multi-hop question answering (QA) datasets that truly stress a model's retrieval and reasoning abilities remains highly challenging recently. While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents.\n  To address this, we present an automated framework for generating high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching. The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.",

However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.",

Based on these findings, we propose UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration in autonomous vehicle decision-making. UniPlanner achieves unified cross-dataset learning through three synergistic innovations.\n  First, the History-Future Trajectory Dictionary Network (HFTDN) aggregates history-future trajectory pairs from multiple datasets, using historical trajectory similarity to retrieve relevant futures and generate cross-dataset planning guidance.\n  Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making the planning knowledge safely transferable.

A challenging yet impactful frontier is the development of GUI agents, which must navigate complex desktop and web interfaces while maintaining robustness and generalization. Existing paradigms typically model tasks as long-chain executions, concatenating historical trajectories into the context. While approaches such as Mirage and GTA1 refine planning or introduce multi-branch action selection, they remain constrained by two persistent issues: Dependence on historical trajectories, which amplifies error propagation. And Local exploration bias, where \"decision-first, observation-later\" mechanisms overlook critical interface cues. We introduce the Memory-Driven GUI Agent (MGA), which reframes GUI interaction around the principle of observe first, then decide. MGA models each step as an independent, context-rich environment state represented by a triad: current screenshot, task-agnostic spatial information, and a dynamically updated structured memory. Experiments on OSworld benchmarks, real desktop applications (Chrome, VSCode, VLC), and cross-task transfer demonstrate that MGA achieves substantial gains in robustness, generalization, and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen. In this paper, we propose and empirically evaluate several alternative intra-abstraction policies, several of which outperform the random policy across a majority of environments and parameter settings.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24299v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources, such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths. Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%.",

This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.",

Modern artificial neural networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks, regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models, large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not \"identical twins\". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the brain.",

In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks.

Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.",

However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.",

In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.",

However, constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services.\n  This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24461v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging its warm-up period.\n  We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning, we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques, including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points under the same conditions. This work advances both the theoretical understanding of surrogate gradient learning in SNNs and practical training methodologies for neuromorphic controllers demonstrated in real-world robotic systems.",

In this work, we propose a cost-efficient two-stage pipeline that reduces reliance on LLMs for data labeling.

We then introduce a graph-based label propagation method that spreads label information to the remaining target examples without additional LLM queries. The resulting fully pseudo-labeled dataset is used to construct in-task demonstrations for ICL. This pipeline combines the flexibility of cross-task supervision with the scalability of LLM-free propagation.

It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer.

As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models.

Unlike traditional neural networks, FMs integrate visual and textual data, interpret symptoms in text, reason about symptom-management relationships, and support interactive QA for growers and educators. Adaptive and imitation learning in robotics further enables field-based disease management. This review screened approx. 40 articles on FM applications for SSDM, focusing on large-language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), and discussing their role in adaptive learning (AL), reinforcement learning (RL), and digital twin frameworks for targeted spraying. Key findings: (a) FMs are gaining traction with surging literature in 2023-24; (b) VLMs outpace LLMs, with a 5-10x increase in publications; (c) RL and AL are still nascent for smart spraying; (d) digital twins with RL can simulate targeted spraying virtually; (e) addressing the sim-to-real gap is critical for real-world deployment; (f) human-robot collaboration remains limited, especially in human-in-the-loop approaches where robots detect early symptoms and humans validate uncertain cases; (g) multi-modal FMs with real-time feedback will drive next-gen SSDM.

While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.",

In this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF.

For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32 accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces inference latency by about $3\\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16 within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability. Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and pipeline fusion.",

We develop a Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.

Using large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical understanding in predictive analytics.

Recent efforts increasingly turn to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering, and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit, step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups: continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements.

To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs structured event hypotheses.

We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible, supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment. It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked) choice modeling into LLM training.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23632v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient, error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.",

A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.",

By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.",

We introduce TEMPEST (TransformErs froM comPressed rEpreSenTations), a method that exploits the inherent byte-stream structure of compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for raw byte-level processing or full media decoding.

Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur further research in generative modeling for inverse design.

However, single model approaches often fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics. The decomposition strategy effectively isolates temporal characteristics, allowing each model to specialize, thereby improving prediction accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.",

Predicting how AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems. Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence, Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35 parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors. Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task characteristics.

Previous work has explored how dense models use \\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts) better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network sparsity exhibit greater \\emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and capability are fundamentally at odds.",

To address these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies, examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous oversight and policy enforcement.

QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt.

We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \\$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios).

To overcome the limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system prediction.",

In practice, these models often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length, discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that, interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models.",

Motivated by this robustness, we examine three hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1) adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without revisiting past data.

The workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific sub-tasks.

Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which were subsequently counted as failures.

We envision a human-LLM interactive system powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems.

This paper introduces a novel evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%. Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and without ground truth references.",

Building upon a pre-existing diffusion architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel) space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields.

OraPlan-SQL ranked first, exceeding the second-best system by more than 6% in execution accuracy (EX), with 55.0% in English and 56.7% in Chinese, while maintaining over 99% SQL validity (VA). Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output selected via majority voting over their executions.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23891v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability. A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria. A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits. Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications.",

Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime, without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >= 0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability strategies should be conducted.",

Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees (RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training. The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets. Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization ability in four hours.",

In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23907v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.",

Traditional fire modeling relies on manual interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework (MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters. Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and static inputs.",

Our approach co-locates integrity verification directly with large ML model execution on GPU accelerators, resolving the fundamental mismatch between how large ML workloads typically run (primarily on GPUs) and how security verifications traditionally operate (on separate CPU-based processes), delivering both immediate performance benefits and long-term architectural consistency. By performing cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g., Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across different GPU vendors and hardware configurations.

However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies, or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore, ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction scripts that can evolve as models improve.

Here, language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23986v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks. These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration, STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally, our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.",

While such models have gained significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders, and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science.

We propose Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input prompts.

However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic, token-level gating mechanism inspired by the \"propose-and-verify\" paradigm of speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively applied only to \"accepted\" tokens, while \"rejected\" tokens are masked out. Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.",

It has important applications in spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$ variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects $m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization.",

Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.\n  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.",

While deep learning models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success, they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To address this, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \\textbf{reference target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream architecture. It provides strong \\textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong \\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}.

PARL-generated topologies reduce contention at the memory cut, meet SLAs, and cut worst-case slowdown to 1.2 times while maintaining competitive mean throughput relative to link-rich meshes. Overall, this reframes NoI design for heterogeneouschiplet accelerators with workload-aware objectives.",

Most classical visual navigation methods are restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-goal visual navigation.

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively.

However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.",

Traditional parameter selection approaches often define fixed constants for specific scenarios. However, they rely on domain expertise and fail to consider the instance-wise features for individual problems, limiting their performance. In contrast, machine learning (ML) approaches, though promising, are hindered by high inference costs and limited interpretability. To combine the strengths of both approaches, we propose a symbolic discovery framework-namely, Symbolic Matrix Preconditioning (SymMaP)-to learn efficient symbolic expressions for preconditioning parameters. Specifically, we employ a neural network to search the high-dimensional discrete space for expressions that can accurately predict the optimal parameters. The learned expression allows for high inference efficiency and excellent interpretability (expressed in concise symbolic formulas), making it simple and reliable for deployment.

We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio, vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in conversational settings, models perform best on text.

Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate, contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by selecting the most accurate imputation technique.

While generative reward models (GRMs) offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand, point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals, eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

To address this, we propose a digital twin (DT)-assisted training and deployment framework. In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring obstacle avoidance.

Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability.

We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.",

    "title": "Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with CLIP and Prompt Learning",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24321v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.",

This ensures that tasks are both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven distinct tasks.

Conventional recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow. In contrast, the emerging generative paradigm replaces embeddings with compact Semantic ID (SID) sequences produced by autoregressive Transformers. Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks?

Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size.

To address this, adaptive convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness. Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes.

Aggregation of these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples, which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24519v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.",

However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis. Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster, more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon publication.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24574v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training. Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance.

However, adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored, especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark. Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA, particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24637v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However, the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to 3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures. Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24639v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.",

However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

That is surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore, in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies over actions.",

We test this framework on three medical QA\n  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways.

However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative \"near-miss\" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these \"near-misses\". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline.

Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks.

The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.24709v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2208.07777v4 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The Maximum Independent Set problem is fundamental for extracting conflict-free structure from large graphs, with applications in scheduling, recommendation, and network analysis. However, existing heuristics can stagnate when search schedules are fixed and information from past solutions is underused, leading to wasted effort in low-quality regions of the search space. We present ARCIS, an efficient algorithm for mining large independent sets on massive graphs. ARCIS couples two main components. The first is an adaptive restart policy that refreshes exploration when progress slows. The second is Consensus-Guided Vertex Fixing, which restricts the search to the non-consensus region of the graph by fixing vertices consistently observed within a round. The consensus is maintained as a running intersection within each round, and because it is recomputed at every restart, the fixing is reversible. Vertices that later lose support are automatically unfixed and their neighborhoods re-enter the working graph, which corrects occasional mistakes while preserving progress. Experiments on 222 graphs from four benchmark suites show that ARCIS attains the best or tied-best solution quality in most instances while delivering competitive runtime and low variability. Ablation studies isolate the impact of each component, indicating that ARCIS is a practical and robust method for large-scale graph mining.",

As such, game agents offer a valuable testbed for exploring capabilities relevant to Artificial General Intelligence. Recently, the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides new opportunities to endow these agents with generalizable reasoning, memory, and adaptability in complex game environments. This survey offers an up-to-date review of LLM-based game agents (LLMGAs) through a unified reference architecture. At the single-agent level, we synthesize existing studies around three core components: memory, reasoning, and perception-action interfaces, which jointly characterize how language enables agents to perceive, think, and act. At the multi-agent level, we outline how communication protocols and organizational models support coordination, role differentiation, and large-scale social behaviors. To contextualize these designs, we introduce a challenge-centered taxonomy linking six major game genres to their dominant agent requirements, from low-latency control in action games to open-ended goal formation in sandbox worlds.

This branching is caused by the large number of candidate proof tactics which can be applied to a given goal. Nonetheless, many of these tactics are semantically similar or lead to an execution error, wasting valuable resources in both cases. We address the problem of effectively pruning this search, using only synthetic data generated from previous proof attempts. We first demonstrate that it is possible to generate semantically aware tactic representations which capture the effect on the proving environment, likelihood of success, and execution time. We then propose a novel filtering mechanism which leverages these representations to select semantically diverse and high quality tactics, using Determinantal Point Processes. Our approach, 3D- Prover, is designed to be general, and to augment any underlying tactic generator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D-Prover on the miniF2F and LeanDojo benchmarks by augmenting popular open source proving LLMs. We show that our approach leads to an increase in the overall proof rate, as well as a significant improvement in the tactic success rate, execution time and diversity.

Effective adaptation of LLMs for MTSC necessitates informative data representations. Existing LLM-based methods directly encode embeddings for time series within the latent space of LLMs from scratch to align with semantic space of LLMs. Despite their effectiveness, we reveal that these methods conceal three inherent bottlenecks: (1) they struggle to encode temporal and channel-specific information in a lossless manner, both of which are critical components of multivariate time series; (2) it is much difficult to align the learned representation space with the semantic space of the LLMs; (3) they require task-specific retraining, which is both computationally expensive and labor-intensive. To bridge these gaps, we propose TableTime, which reformulates MTSC as a table understanding task. Specifically, TableTime introduces the following strategies: (1) convert multivariate time series into a tabular form, thus minimizing information loss to the greatest extent; (2) represent tabular time series in text format to achieve natural alignment with the semantic space of LLMs; (3) design a reasoning framework that integrates contextual text information, neighborhood assistance, multi-path inference and problem decomposition to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs and realize zero-shot classification. Extensive experiments performed on 10 publicly representative datasets from UEA archive verify the superiorities of the TableTime.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.21142v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.",

To build AI systems with this capability, we must first understand its building blocks: does such flexibility require explicit, dedicated mechanisms for modelling others -- or can it emerge spontaneously from the pressures of open-ended cooperative interaction? To investigate this question, we train simple model-free RNN agents to collaborate with a population of diverse partners. Using the `Overcooked-AI' environment, we collect data from thousands of collaborative teams, and analyse agents' internal hidden states. Despite a lack of additional architectural features, inductive biases, or auxiliary objectives, the agents nevertheless develop structured internal representations of their partners' task abilities, enabling rapid adaptation and generalisation to novel collaborators. We investigated these internal models through probing techniques, and large-scale behavioural analysis. Notably, we find that structured partner modelling emerges when agents can influence partner behaviour by controlling task allocation. Our results show that partner modelling can arise spontaneously in model-free agents -- but only under environmental conditions that impose the right kind of social pressure.",

This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.\n  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$ cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling probability of $100\\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\\%$ for 6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of $\\sim 20\\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed method.\n  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution without degrading solution quality.

Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts.

HAI focuses on the interaction layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn, operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) - Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge, thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective intelligence.

We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G\\\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G\\\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance, matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents.

Moreover, a comprehensive and standardized framework for assessing the trustworthiness of LLM-generated radiology reports is yet to be established. This study aims to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM-generated liver MRI reports by introducing a Multi-Dimensional Credibility Assessment (MDCA) framework and providing guidance on institution-specific prompt optimization.

Previous research focuses on training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today. Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate. Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the series.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23564v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization. We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action, enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity. Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich, multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control.

However, the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go, aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data. However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback (e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents (Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.",

Deciding whether a query answer holds under these semantics is (co)NP-complete in data complexity for a large class of logical theories, and SAT-based procedures have been devised for repair-based semantics when there is no priority relation, or the relation has a special structure. The present paper introduces the first SAT encodings for Pareto- and completion-optimal repairs w.r.t. general priority relations and proposes several ways of employing existing and new encodings to compute answers under (optimal) repair-based semantics, by exploiting different reasoning modes of SAT solvers. The comprehensive experimental evaluation of our implementation compares both (i) the impact of adopting semantics based on different kinds of repairs, and (ii) the relative performances of alternative procedures for the same semantics.",

Recently, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities to reason with both language and visual data. Although many works have focused on leveraging VLMs for navigation in open scenes, they often require high computational cost, rely on object-centric approaches, or depend on environmental priors in detailed human instructions. We introduce Navigation with VLM (NavVLM), a training-free framework that harnesses open-source VLMs to enable robots to navigate effectively, even for human-friendly language goal such as abstract places, actions, or specific objects in open scenes. NavVLM leverages the VLM as its cognitive core to perceive environmental information and constantly provides exploration guidance achieving intelligent navigation with only a neat target rather than a detailed instruction with environment prior. We evaluated and validated NavVLM in both simulation and real-world experiments. In simulation, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) on object-specifc tasks in richly detailed environments from Matterport 3D (MP3D), Habitat Matterport 3D (HM3D) and Gibson.

However, similar analyses and approaches have been lacking for text-to-image models. We investigate the possibility of using SAEs to learn interpretable features for SDXL Turbo, a few-step text-to-image diffusion model. To this end, we train SAEs on the updates performed by transformer blocks within SDXL Turbo's denoising U-net in its 1-step setting. Interestingly, we find that they generalize to 4-step SDXL Turbo and even to the multi-step SDXL base model (i.e., a different model) without additional training. In addition, we show that their learned features are interpretable, causally influence the generation process, and reveal specialization among the blocks. We do so by creating RIEBench, a representation-based image editing benchmark, for editing images while they are generated by turning on and off individual SAE features. This allows us to track which transformer blocks' features are the most impactful depending on the edit category. Our work is the first investigation of SAEs for interpretability in text-to-image diffusion models and our results establish SAEs as a promising approach for understanding and manipulating the internal mechanisms of text-to-image models.",

The first one is a two-stage knockout-style algorithm: given an input problem, it first generates multiple candidate solutions, and then aggregate them via a knockout tournament for the final output. Assuming that the LLM can generate a correct solution with non-zero probability and do better than a random guess in comparing a pair of correct and incorrect solutions, we prove theoretically that the failure probability of this algorithm decays to zero exponentially or by a power law (depending on the specific way of scaling) as its test-time compute grows. The second one is a two-stage league-style algorithm, where each candidate is evaluated by its average win rate against multiple opponents, rather than eliminated upon loss to a single opponent. Under analogous but more robust assumptions, we prove that its failure probability also decays to zero exponentially with more test-time compute. Both algorithms require a black-box LLM and nothing else (e.g., no verifier or reward model) for a minimalistic implementation, which makes them appealing for practical applications and easy to adapt for different tasks. Through extensive experiments with diverse models and datasets, we validate the proposed theories and demonstrate the outstanding scaling properties of both algorithms.",

The rapid rise of Artificial Intelligence for Software Engineering (AI4SE) has produced numerous benchmarks for tasks such as code generation and bug repair. However, this proliferation has led to major challenges: (1) fragmented knowledge across tasks, (2) difficulty in selecting contextually relevant benchmarks, (3) lack of standardization in benchmark creation, and (4) flaws that limit utility. Addressing these requires a dual approach: systematically mapping existing benchmarks for informed selection and defining unified guidelines for robust, adaptable benchmark development.\n  We conduct a review of 247 studies, identifying 273 AI4SE benchmarks since 2014. We categorize them, analyze limitations, and expose gaps in current practices. Building on these insights, we introduce BenchScout, an extensible semantic search tool for locating suitable benchmarks. BenchScout employs automated clustering with contextual embeddings of benchmark-related studies, followed by dimensionality reduction. In a user study with 22 participants, BenchScout achieved usability, effectiveness, and intuitiveness scores of 4.5, 4.0, and 4.1 out of 5.\n  To improve benchmarking standards, we propose BenchFrame, a unified framework for enhancing benchmark quality. Applying BenchFrame to HumanEval yielded HumanEvalNext, featuring corrected errors, improved language conversion, higher test coverage, and greater difficulty.

Leveraging these generalized entropies yields MD \\& GEG algorithms with improved convergence behavior, robustness to vanishing and exploding gradients, and inherent adaptability to non-Euclidean geometries through mirror maps. We establish deep connections between these methods and Amari's natural gradient, revealing a unified geometric foundation for additive, multiplicative, and natural gradient updates. Focusing on the Tsallis, Kaniadakis, Sharma--Taneja--Mittal, and Kaniadakis--Lissia--Scarfone entropy families, we show that each entropy induces a distinct Riemannian metric on the parameter space, leading to GEG algorithms that preserve the natural statistical geometry. The tunable parameters of deformed logarithms enable adaptive geometric selection, providing enhanced robustness and convergence over classical Euclidean optimization. Overall, our framework unifies key first-order MD optimization methods under a single information-geometric perspective based on generalized Bregman divergences, where the choice of entropy determines the underlying metric and dual geometric structure.",

Camera-based setups offer a cost-effective option by using stereo depth estimation to generate dense, high-resolution depth maps without relying on expensive active sensing. However, existing omnidirectional stereo matching approaches achieve only limited depth accuracy across diverse environments, depth ranges, and lighting conditions, due to the scarcity of real-world data. We present DFI-OmniStereo, a novel omnidirectional stereo matching method that leverages a large-scale pre-trained foundation model for relative monocular depth estimation within an iterative optimization-based stereo matching architecture. We introduce a dedicated two-stage training strategy to utilize the relative monocular depth features for our omnidirectional stereo matching before scale-invariant fine-tuning. DFI-OmniStereo achieves state-of-the-art results on the real-world Helvipad dataset, reducing disparity MAE by approximately 16% compared to the previous best omnidirectional stereo method.",

However, this approach significantly increases computational costs and inference time, as the model must generate and evaluate multiple candidate solutions to identify a viable reasoning path. To address this, we propose an effective approach that integrates search capabilities directly into the model by fine-tuning it on unpaired successful (learning) and failed reasoning paths (forgetting) derived from diverse search methods. A key challenge we identify is that naive fine-tuning can degrade the model's search capability; we show this can be mitigated with a smaller learning rate. Extensive experiments on the challenging Game-of-24 and Countdown arithmetic puzzles show that, replacing CoT-generated data with search-generated data for offline fine-tuning improves success rates by around 23% over inference-time search baselines, while reducing inference time by 180$\\times$. On top of this, our learning and forgetting objective consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and preference-based methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.19467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, benchmarking on large-scale real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) is critical, as clinical decisions are directly informed by these sources, yet current evaluations remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world clinical data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. It covers eight major task types spanning the entire continuum of patient care across six clinical stages and 20 representative applications, including triage and referral, consultation, information extraction, diagnosis, prognosis, and billing coding, and involves 14 clinical specialties. We systematically evaluated 95 LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini series, and Qwen3 series) under various inference strategies. Our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.\n  The BRIDGE leaderboard: https://huggingface.co/spaces/YLab-Open/BRIDGE-Medical-Leaderboard",

However, their scalability to multi-turn LLM agent training remains limited. Unlike static tasks, agent-environment interactions unfold over many steps and often yield sparse or delayed rewards, making credit assignment across individual steps significantly more challenging. In this work, we propose Group-in-Group Policy Optimization (GiGPO), a novel RL algorithm that achieves fine-grained credit assignment for LLM agents while preserving the appealing properties of group-based RL: critic-free, low memory, and stable convergence. GiGPO introduces a two-level structure for estimating relative advantage: (i) At the episode-level, GiGPO computes macro relative advantages based on groups of complete trajectories; (ii) At the step-level, GiGPO introduces an anchor state grouping mechanism that retroactively constructs step-level groups by identifying repeated environment states across trajectories. Actions stemming from the same state are grouped together, enabling micro relative advantage estimation. This hierarchical structure effectively captures both global trajectory quality and local step effectiveness without relying on auxiliary models or additional rollouts. We evaluate GiGPO on challenging agent benchmarks, including ALFWorld and WebShop, as well as tool-integrated reasoning on search-augmented QA tasks, using Qwen2.5-1.5B/3B/7B-Instruct. Crucially, GiGPO delivers fine-grained per-step credit signals, achieves performance gains of > 12% on ALFWorld and > 9% on WebShop over GRPO, and obtains superior performance on QA tasks (42.1% on 3B and 47.2% on 7B): all while maintaining the same GPU memory overhead, identical LLM rollout, and incurring little to no additional time cost.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.11930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In recent years, the expressive power of various neural architectures -- including graph neural networks (GNNs), transformers, and recurrent neural networks -- has been characterised using tools from logic and formal language theory. As the capabilities of basic architectures are becoming well understood, increasing attention is turning to models that combine multiple architectural paradigms. Among them particularly important, and challenging to analyse, are temporal extensions of GNNs, which integrate both spatial (graph-structure) and temporal (evolution over time) dimensions. In this paper, we initiate the study of logical characterisation of temporal GNNs by connecting them to two-dimensional product logics. We show that the expressive power of temporal GNNs depends on how graph and temporal components are combined. In particular, temporal GNNs that apply static GNNs recursively over time can capture all properties definable in the product logic of (past) propositional temporal logic PTL and the modal logic K. In contrast, architectures such as graph-and-time TGNNs and global TGNNs can only express restricted fragments of this logic, where the interaction between temporal and spatial operators is syntactically constrained. These provide us with the first results on the logical expressiveness of temporal GNNs.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel GLS perspective to CDGE and modelize the cross-domain problem by label and conditional shift problem. A GLS correction framework is presented and a feasible realization is proposed, in which a importance reweighting strategy based on truncated Gaussian distribution is introduced to overcome the continuity challenges in label shift correction. To embed the reweighted source distribution to conditional invariant learning, we further derive a probability-aware estimation of conditional operator discrepancy.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.13898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Modern LLMs are increasingly deep, and depth correlates with performance, albeit with diminishing returns. However, do these models use their depth efficiently? Do they compose more features to create higher-order computations that are impossible in shallow models, or do they merely spread the same kinds of computation out over more layers? To address these questions, we analyze the residual stream of the Llama 3.1, Qwen 3, and OLMo 2 family of models. We find: First, comparing the output of the sublayers to the residual stream reveals that layers in the second half contribute much less than those in the first half, with a clear phase transition between the two halves. Second, skipping layers in the second half has a much smaller effect on future computations and output predictions. Third, for multihop tasks, we are unable to find evidence that models are using increased depth to compose subresults in examples involving many hops. Fourth, we seek to directly address whether deeper models are using their additional layers to perform new kinds of computation. To do this, we train linear maps from the residual stream of a shallow model to a deeper one. We find that layers with the same relative depth map best to each other, suggesting that the larger model simply spreads the same computations out over its many layers. All this evidence suggests that deeper models are not using their depth to learn new kinds of computation, but only using the greater depth to perform more fine-grained adjustments to the residual. This may help explain why increasing scale leads to diminishing returns for stacked Transformer architectures.",

State-space models (SSMs) are already more efficient than AR Transformers, since their state summarizes all past data with no need to cache or re-process tokens in the sliding window context. However, their state can also comprise thousands of tokens; so, speculative decoding has recently been extended to SSMs. Existing approaches, however, do not leverage the tree-based verification methods, since current SSMs lack the means to compute a token tree efficiently. We propose the first scalable algorithm to perform tree-based speculative decoding in state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures of SSMs and Transformer layers. We exploit the structure of accumulated state transition matrices to facilitate tree-based speculative decoding with minimal overhead relative to current SSM implementations. Along with the algorithm, we describe a hardware-aware implementation that improves naive application of AR Transformer tree-based speculative decoding methods to SSMs. Furthermore, we outperform vanilla speculative decoding with SSMs even with a baseline drafting model and tree structure on three different benchmarks, opening up opportunities for further speed up with SSM and hybrid model inference.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.16947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment, current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks, proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better robustness (ALO-ASR < 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR > 50%), while maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT's discrete-continuous defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer LLMs. We provide our code and models at https://github.com/insait-institute/MixAT.",

Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space.

Although modern technology offers unparalleled opportunities for learning, existing automated systems for evaluating recitation have struggled to gain broad acceptance or demonstrate educational effectiveness. This literature review examines this crucial disparity, offering a thorough analysis of scholarly research, digital platforms, and commercial tools developed over the past twenty years. Our analysis uncovers a fundamental flaw in current approaches that adapt Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which emphasize word identification over qualitative acoustic evaluation. These systems suffer from limitations such as reliance on biased datasets, demographic disparities, and an inability to deliver meaningful feedback for improvement. Challenging these data-centric methodologies, we advocate for a paradigm shift toward a knowledge-based computational framework. By leveraging the unchanging nature of the Quranic text and the well-defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that an effective evaluation system should be built upon rule-based acoustic modeling centered on canonical pronunciation principles and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than depending on statistical patterns derived from flawed or biased data. The review concludes that the future of automated Quranic recitation assessment lies in hybrid systems that combine linguistic expertise with advanced audio processing.

In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data.

    "title": "Improving Data Efficiency for LLM Reinforcement Fine-tuning Through Difficulty-targeted Online Data Selection and Rollout Replay",
    "summary": "arXiv:2506.05316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become an effective approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), particularly to enhance their reasoning capabilities. However, RL fine-tuning remains highly resource-intensive, and existing work has largely overlooked the problem of data efficiency. In this paper, we propose two techniques to improve data efficiency in LLM RL fine-tuning: difficulty-targeted online data selection and rollout replay. We introduce the notion of adaptive difficulty to guide online data selection, prioritizing questions of moderate difficulty that are more likely to yield informative learning signals. To estimate adaptive difficulty efficiently, we develop an attention-based framework that requires rollouts for only a small reference set of questions. The adaptive difficulty of the remaining questions is then estimated based on their similarity to this set. To further reduce rollout cost, we introduce a rollout replay mechanism inspired by experience replay in traditional RL. This technique reuses recent rollouts, lowering per-step computation while maintaining stable updates. Experiments across 6 LLM-dataset combinations show that our method reduces RL fine-tuning time by 23% to 62% while reaching the same level of performance as the original GRPO algorithm.

    "summary": "arXiv:2506.05426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting RL agents to downstream tasks through prompt conditioning. However, two notable challenges remain in fully harnessing in-context learning within RL domains: the intrinsic multi-modality of the state-action-reward data and the diverse, heterogeneous nature of decision tasks. To tackle these challenges, we propose T2MIR (Token- and Task-wise MoE for In-context RL), an innovative framework that introduces architectural advances of mixture-of-experts (MoE) into transformer-based decision models. T2MIR substitutes the feedforward layer with two parallel layers: a token-wise MoE that captures distinct semantics of input tokens across multiple modalities, and a task-wise MoE that routes diverse tasks to specialized experts for managing a broad task distribution with alleviated gradient conflicts. To enhance task-wise routing, we introduce a contrastive learning method that maximizes the mutual information between the task and its router representation, enabling more precise capture of task-relevant information. The outputs of two MoE components are concatenated and fed into the next layer. Comprehensive experiments show that T2MIR significantly facilitates in-context learning capacity and outperforms various types of baselines. We bring the potential and promise of MoE to ICRL, offering a simple and scalable architectural enhancement to advance ICRL one step closer toward achievements in language and vision communities.

This study evaluates the Educational AI Hub, an AI-powered learning framework, implemented in undergraduate civil and environmental engineering courses at a large R1 public university. Using a mixed-methods design combining pre- and post-surveys, system usage logs, and qualitative analysis of students' AI interactions, the research examines perceptions of trust, ethics, usability, and learning outcomes. Findings show that students valued the AI assistant for its accessibility and comfort, with nearly half reporting greater ease using it than seeking help from instructors or teaching assistants. The tool was most helpful for completing homework and understanding concepts, though views on its instructional quality were mixed. Ethical uncertainty, particularly around institutional policy and academic integrity, emerged as a key barrier to full engagement. Overall, students regarded AI as a supplement rather than a replacement for human instruction. The study highlights the importance of usability, ethical transparency, and faculty guidance in promoting meaningful AI engagement.

However, misalignment between the dominant sound and the noise-such as mismatched downbeats-often requires an excessive volume increase to achieve effective masking. Motivated by recent advances in cross-modal generation, in this work, we introduce an alternative method to acoustic masking, aiming to reduce the noticeability of environmental noises by blending them into personalized music generated based on user-provided text prompts. Following the paradigm of music generation using mel-spectrogram representations, we propose a Blending Noises into Personalized Music (BNMusic) framework with two key stages. The first stage synthesizes a complete piece of music in a mel-spectrogram representation that encapsulates the musical essence of the noise. In the second stage, we adaptively amplify the generated music segment to further reduce noise perception and enhance the blending effectiveness, while preserving auditory quality. Our experiments with comprehensive evaluations on MusicBench, EPIC-SOUNDS, and ESC-50 demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting the ability to blend environmental noise with rhythmically aligned, adaptively amplified, and enjoyable music segments, minimizing the noticeability of the noise, thereby improving overall acoustic experiences.

Quantization offers a solution, yet performance degradation in the sub-1-bit regime remains particularly difficult. This paper introduces LittleBit, a novel method for extreme LLM compression. It targets levels like 0.1 bits per weight (BPW), achieving nearly 31$\\times$ memory reduction, e.g., Llama2-13B to under 0.9 GB. LittleBit represents weights in a low-rank form using latent matrix factorization, subsequently binarizing these factors. To counteract information loss from this extreme precision, it integrates a multi-scale compensation mechanism. This includes row, column, and an additional latent dimension that learns per-rank importance. Two key contributions enable effective training: Dual Sign-Value-Independent Decomposition (Dual-SVID) for quantization-aware training (QAT) initialization, and integrated Residual Compensation to mitigate errors. Extensive experiments confirm LittleBit's superiority in sub-1-bit quantization: e.g., its 0.1 BPW performance on Llama2-7B surpasses the leading method's 0.7 BPW. LittleBit establishes a new, viable size-performance trade-off--unlocking a potential 11.6$\\times$ speedup over FP16 at the kernel level--and makes powerful LLMs practical for resource-constrained environments.",

We demonstrate a machine learning approach for rapid, non-destructive estimation of the chemical potential and temperature from a single image of an \\emph{in situ} imaged density profiles of finite-temperature Bose gases. Our convolutional neural network is trained exclusively on quasi-2D `pancake' condensates in harmonic trap configurations. It achieves parameter extraction within fractions of a second. The model also demonstrates {some} zero-shot generalisation across both trap geometry and thermalisation dynamics, successfully estimating the temperature (although not the chemical potential) for toroidally trapped condensates with errors of only a few nanokelvin despite no prior exposure to such geometries during training, and maintaining predictive accuracy during dynamic thermalisation processes after a relatively brief evolution without explicit training on non-equilibrium states. These results suggest that supervised learning can overcome traditional limitations in ultracold atom thermometry, with extension to broader geometric configurations, temperature ranges, and additional parameters potentially enabling comprehensive real-time analysis of quantum gas experiments. Such capabilities could significantly streamline experimental workflows whilst improving measurement precision across a range of quantum fluid systems.",

To address these limitations, this work first proposes a Region-Aware Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (RMCoT) dataset, in which the process of producing an answer is preceded by a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps that explicitly ground relevant visual regions of the medical image, thereby providing fine-grained explainability. Furthermore, we introduce a novel verifiable reward mechanism for reinforcement learning to guide post-training, improving the alignment between the model's reasoning process and its final answer. Remarkably, our method achieves comparable performance using only one-eighth of the training data, demonstrating the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal.

While several unlearning benchmarks have been established for LLMs, a practical evaluation framework for unlearning in LMMs has been less explored. Specifically, existing unlearning benchmark for LMMs considers only scenarios in which the model is required to unlearn fine-tuned knowledge through a single unlearning operation. In this study, we introduce PULSE protocol for realistic unlearning scenarios for LMMs by introducing two critical perspectives: (i) Pre-trained knowledge Unlearning for analyzing the effect across different knowledge acquisition phases and (ii) Long-term Sustainability Evaluation to address sequential requests. We then evaluate existing unlearning methods along these dimensions. Our results reveal that, although some techniques can successfully unlearn knowledge acquired through fine-tuning, they struggle to eliminate information learned during pre-training. Moreover, methods that effectively unlearn a batch of target data in a single operation exhibit substantial performance degradation when the same data are split and unlearned sequentially.",

This new paradigm can lead to solutions that require less supervision while, at the same time, providing a model that can generalize and answer questions beyond the training labels. Existing proposals often use some description of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM. For a chosen class of graphs, if a well-tailored graph encoder is deployed to play together with a pre-trained LLM, the model can answer graph-related questions well. Existing solutions to graph-based prompts range from graph serialization to graph transformers. In this work, we show that the use of a parameter-free graph encoder based on Fock space representations, a concept borrowed from mathematical physics, is remarkably versatile in this problem setting. The simple construction, inherited directly from the theory with a few small adjustments, can provide rich and informative graph encodings, for a wide range of different graphs. We investigate the use of this idea for prefix-tuned prompts leveraging the capabilities of a pre-trained, frozen LLM. The modifications lead to a model that can answer graph-related questions -- from simple graphs to proteins to hypergraphs -- effectively and with minimal, if any, adjustments to the architecture. Our work significantly simplifies existing solutions and generalizes well to multiple different graph-based structures effortlessly.",

Multi-scale quantization addresses this challenge by enabling memory-efficient runtime model adaptation of LLMs through the overlaying of multiple model variants quantized to different bitwidths. Meanwhile, an important question still remains open-ended: how can models be properly configured to match a target precision or latency? While mixed-precision offers a promising solution, we take this further by leveraging the key observation that the sensitivity of each layer dynamically changes across decoding steps. Building on this insight, we introduce DP-LLM, a novel mechanism that dynamically assigns precision to each layer based on input values. Experimental results across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DP-LLM achieves a superior performance-latency trade-off, outperforming prior approaches.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2508.19563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being applied in a wide array of settings, well beyond the typical language-oriented use cases. In particular, LLMs are increasingly used as a plug-and-play method for fitting data and generating predictions. Prior work has shown that LLMs, via in-context learning or supervised fine-tuning, can perform competitively with many tabular supervised learning techniques in terms of predictive performance. However, we identify a critical vulnerability of using LLMs for data fitting -- making changes to data representation that are completely irrelevant to the underlying learning task can drastically alter LLMs' predictions on the same data. For example, simply changing variable names can sway the size of prediction error by as much as 82% in certain settings. Such prediction sensitivity with respect to task-irrelevant variations manifests under both in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning, for both close-weight and open-weight general-purpose LLMs. Moreover, by examining the attention scores of an open-weight LLM, we discover a non-uniform attention pattern: training examples and variable names/values which happen to occupy certain positions in the prompt receive more attention when output tokens are generated, even though different positions are expected to receive roughly the same attention. This partially explains the sensitivity in the presence of task-irrelevant variations. We also consider a state-of-the-art tabular foundation model (TabPFN) trained specifically for data fitting. Despite being explicitly designed to achieve prediction robustness, TabPFN is still not immune to task-irrelevant variations. Overall, despite LLMs' impressive predictive capabilities, currently they lack even the basic level of robustness to be used as a principled data-fitting tool.",

This raises important concerns about their robustness and reliability in scientific applications. To support more rigorous evaluation of LLMs in chemical reasoning, we present the MolErr2Fix benchmark, designed to assess LLMs on error detection and correction in molecular descriptions. Unlike existing benchmarks focused on molecule-to-text generation or property prediction, MolErr2Fix emphasizes fine-grained chemical understanding. It tasks LLMs with identifying, localizing, explaining, and revising potential structural and semantic errors in molecular descriptions. Specifically, MolErr2Fix consists of 1,193 fine-grained annotated error instances. Each instance contains quadruple annotations, i.e,. (error type, span location, the explanation, and the correction). These tasks are intended to reflect the types of reasoning and verification required in real-world chemical communication. Evaluations of current state-of-the-art LLMs reveal notable performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust chemical reasoning capabilities.

Here we demonstrate that pre-trained knowledge in large language models (LLMs) fundamentally changes this paradigm. Using six fully enumerated categorical reaction datasets (768-5,684 experiments), we benchmark LLM-guided optimization (LLM-GO) against Bayesian optimization (BO) and random sampling. Frontier LLMs consistently match or exceed BO performance across five single-objective datasets, with advantages growing as parameter complexity increases and high-performing conditions become scarce (<5% of space). BO retains superiority only for explicit multi-objective trade-offs. To understand these contrasting behaviors, we introduce a topology-agnostic information theory framework quantifying sampling diversity throughout optimization campaigns. This analysis reveals that LLMs maintain systematically higher exploration Shannon entropy than BO across all datasets while achieving superior performance, with advantages most pronounced in solution-scarce parameter spaces where high-entropy exploration typically fails-suggesting that pre-trained domain knowledge enables more effective navigation of chemical parameter space rather than replacing structured exploration strategies. To enable transparent benchmarking and community validation, we release Iron Mind (https://gomes.andrew.cmu.edu/iron-mind), a no-code platform for side-by-side evaluation of human, algorithmic, and LLM optimization campaigns with public leaderboards and complete trajectories.

This paper formally challenges the economic validity of this widespread assumption, arguing that the true bottom-line economic utility of a human-machine skill policy is dangerously misunderstood and highly contingent on situational and design factors. To investigate this gap, we develop an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical pragmatism to quantify the economic impact of human and machine skills in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results show that a human-machine strategy can yield the highest economic utility in complex scenarios, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine approach can perform worse than either the machine-exclusive or the human-exclusive policy, actively destroying value under the pressure of costs that are not compensated by sufficient performance gains. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: when the context is complex and critical, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and far from being a silver-bullet solution or a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.",

While existing ultra-low-bit PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms, they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to 1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2) model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4% mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU days for training-based methods.

To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance on texture.

Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs, PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context, reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.00037v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0 demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing, and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations. Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four modalities.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.01161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability. Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates. Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and matches on-policy performance.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.02999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency.\n  To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UJA can achieve over 80% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20%.",

    "title": "Distilled Protein Backbone Generation",
    "summary": "arXiv:2510.03095v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Diffusion- and flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance in protein backbone generation tasks, offering unprecedented capabilities for de novo protein design. However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.

Unlike traditional emotion recognition tasks that assign a single label to an entire sentence, SEER targets the underexplored task of emotion evidence detection: pinpointing which exact phrases convey emotion. This span-level approach is crucial for applications like empathetic dialogue and clinical support, which need to know how emotion is expressed, not just what the emotion is. SEER includes two tasks: identifying emotion evidence within a single sentence, and identifying evidence across a short passage of five consecutive sentences. It contains new annotations for both emotion and emotion evidence on 1200 real-world sentences. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs and find that, while some models approach average human performance on single-sentence inputs, their accuracy degrades in longer passages.

Our approach uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50% computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.",

Speculative decoding (SD) substantially improves LLM inference efficiency. However, its utility is limited by a fundamental constraint: the draft and target models must share the same vocabulary, thus limiting the herd of available draft models and often necessitating the training of a new model from scratch. Inspired by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a classic algorithm for aligning time series, we propose the algorithm TokenTiming for universal speculative decoding. It operates by re-encoding the draft token sequence to get a new target token sequence, and then uses DTW to build a mapping to transfer the probability distributions for speculative sampling. Benefiting from this, our method accommodates mismatched vocabularies and works with any off-the-shelf models without retraining and modification. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various tasks, demonstrating 1.57x speedup.

This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered \"saturated\", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.",

Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys.

The predominant approach, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), suffers from poor generalization as it trains models to imitate a static set of teacher trajectories rather than learn a robust methodology. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers an alternative, the standard RL using sparse rewards fails to effectively guide SLMs, causing them to struggle with inefficient exploration and adopt suboptimal strategies. To address these distinct challenges, we propose MENTOR, a framework that synergistically combines RL with teacher-guided distillation. Instead of simple imitation, MENTOR employs an RL-based process to learn a more generalizable policy through exploration. In addition, to solve the problem of reward sparsity, it uses a teacher's reference trajectory to construct a dense, composite teacher-guided reward that provides fine-grained guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MENTOR significantly improves the cross-domain generalization and strategic competence of SLMs compared to both SFT and standard sparse-reward RL baselines.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.21729v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Dense embedding models have become critical for modern information retrieval, particularly in RAG pipelines, but their performance often degrades when applied to specialized corpora outside their pre-training distribution. To address thi we introduce CustomIR, a framework for unsupervised adaptation of pre-trained language embedding models to domain-specific corpora using synthetically generated query-document pairs. CustomIR leverages large language models (LLMs) to create diverse queries grounded in a known target corpus, paired with LLM-verified hard negatives, eliminating the need for costly human annotation. Experiments on enterprise email and messaging datasets show that CustomIR consistently improves retrieval effectiveness with small models gaining up to 2.3 points in Recall@10. This performance increase allows these small models to rival the performance of much larger alternatives, allowing for cheaper RAG deployments. These results highlight that targeted synthetic fine-tuning offers a scalable and cost-efficient strategy for increasing domain-specific performance.",

Empirically, we find that a dataset produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6% human validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from 2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16% human-validated accuracy$\\unicode{x2014}$compared to 57.6% on a dataset generated by recent work. Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data, models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6 question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5% on BDD and 37.9% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as BLINK.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.22379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression. However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source. Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions, highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.",

While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav. Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation (HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.22931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Continual Learning (CL) is essential for enabling self-evolving large language models (LLMs) to adapt and remain effective amid rapid knowledge growth. Yet, despite its importance, little attention has been given to establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP) has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees. Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability of CP under CDP scenarios.

    "summary": "arXiv:2510.23409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \\emph{Eigen-Value} (EV), a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to OOD-robust data valuation.",

Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process.

In this paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again until reaching a satisfactory confidence level.

In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation. Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion methods.

    "title": "Routing Matters in MoE: Scaling Diffusion Transformers with Explicit Routing Guidance",
    "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives.

In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an \"interlingua\" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.",

    "summary": "LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.",

A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance.

This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative \"near-miss\" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these \"near-misses\". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.",

STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\\% temporal, -35.2\\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.",

    "title": "SPICE: Self-Play In Corpus Environments Improves Reasoning",
    "summary": "Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics, the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich, near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained self-improvement.",

    "title": "InteractComp: Evaluating Search Agents With Ambiguous Queries",
    "summary": "Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

    "title": "Group Relative Attention Guidance for Image Editing",
    "summary": "Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at https://github.com/little-misfit/GRAG-Image-Editing.",

    "summary": "Function calling (FC) empowers large language models (LLMs) and autonomous agents to interface with external tools, a critical capability for solving complex, real-world problems. As this ability becomes increasingly central to advanced AI systems, the need for high-quality, multi-turn training data to develop and refine it cannot be overstated. Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use. FunReason-MT resolves the complexity barrier in multi-turn FC data by employing 1) Environment-API Graph Interactions to gather varied high-quality trajectories, 2) Advanced Tool-Query Synthesis to simplify hard query construction, and 3) Guided Iterative Chain for sophisticated CoT generation. Evaluations on Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCLv3) demonstrate the power of our framework: a 4B model built upon FunReason-MT generated data achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable-sized models, outperforming most close-source models. Further performance improvements on BFCLv4 confirm that FunReason-MT provides a reliable and robust source for agentic learning.",

    "summary": "Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.",

    "summary": "With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP, the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents' tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1% to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted environments.

    "title": "Latent Sketchpad: Sketching Visual Thoughts to Elicit Multimodal Reasoning in MLLMs",
    "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual foundation models.",

    "title": "Critique-RL: Training Language Models for Critiquing through Two-Stage Reinforcement Learning",
    "summary": "Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.",

    "summary": "To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335 researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement, alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.",

However, existing training algorithms such as SFT, PPO, and GRPO may not generalize well across unseen reasoning tasks and heavily rely on a biased reward model. To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the state-of-the-art LVLMs on seven reasoning benchmarks, in terms of effectiveness, generalization, and interpretability.",

Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue, environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and proactive assistance.",

Unlike API- or GUI-based approaches, this paradigm enables large-scale continual pre-training across heterogeneous domains, including OS, web, and simulation games. Game-TARS is pre-trained on over 500B tokens with diverse trajectories and multimodal data. Key techniques include a decaying continual loss to reduce causal confusion and an efficient Sparse-Thinking strategy that balances reasoning depth and inference cost. Experiments show that Game-TARS achieves about 2 times the success rate over the previous sota model on open-world Minecraft tasks, is close to the generality of fresh humans in unseen web 3d games, and outperforms GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, and Claude-4-Sonnet in FPS benchmarks.

    "summary": "Generative models have made significant progress in synthesizing high-fidelity audio from short textual descriptions. However, editing existing audio using natural language has remained largely underexplored. Current approaches either require the complete description of the edited audio or are constrained to predefined edit instructions that lack flexibility. In this work, we introduce SAO-Instruct, a model based on Stable Audio Open capable of editing audio clips using any free-form natural language instruction. To train our model, we create a dataset of audio editing triplets (input audio, edit instruction, output audio) using Prompt-to-Prompt, DDPM inversion, and a manual editing pipeline. Although partially trained on synthetic data, our model generalizes well to real in-the-wild audio clips and unseen edit instructions. We demonstrate that SAO-Instruct achieves competitive performance on objective metrics and outperforms other audio editing approaches in a subjective listening study. To encourage future research, we release our code and model weights.",

    "title": "MMPersuade: A Dataset and Evaluation Framework for Multimodal Persuasion",
    "summary": "As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial, subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust, preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive multimodal content.",

    "summary": "Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints. Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur further research in generative modeling for inverse design.

    "summary": "Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics. Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios, covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across 32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a 19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a 58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5.

    "title": "GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping",
    "summary": "Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.",

This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand, identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to enhancing LLM reliability.",

In this work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date, totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages, and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444 language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.",

    "title": "Beyond Reasoning Gains: Mitigating General Capabilities Forgetting in Large Reasoning Models",
    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation. Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.",

To address these challenges, we introduce three complementary resources for advancing visualization coding agents. VisCode-Multi-679K is a large-scale, supervised dataset containing 679K validated and executable visualization samples with multi-turn correction dialogues across 12 programming languages. VisPlotBench is a benchmark for systematic evaluation, featuring executable tasks, rendered outputs, and protocols for both initial generation and multi-round self-debug. Finally, we present VisCoder2, a family of multi-language visualization models trained on VisCode-Multi-679K. Experiments show that VisCoder2 significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4.1, with further gains from iterative self-debug, reaching 82.4% overall execution pass rate at the 32B scale, particularly in symbolic or compiler-dependent languages.",

    "title": "VL-SAE: Interpreting and Enhancing Vision-Language Alignment with a Unified Concept Set",
    "summary": "The alignment of vision-language representations endows current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities. However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the first challenge, we introduce UltraHR-100K, a high-quality dataset of 100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we design (i) Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS) to focus learning on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) Soft-Weighting Frequency Regularization (SWFR), which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail preservation.

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.",
