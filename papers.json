    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14494v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: A facial morph is an image created by combining two face images pertaining to two distinct identities. Face demorphing inverts the process and tries to recover the original images constituting a facial morph. While morph attack detection (MAD) techniques can be used to flag morph images, they do not divulge any visual information about the faces used to create them. Demorphing helps address this problem. Existing demorphing techniques are either very restrictive (assume identities during testing) or produce feeble outputs (both outputs look very similar). In this paper, we overcome these issues by proposing dc-GAN, a novel GAN-based demorphing method conditioned on the morph images. Our method overcomes morph-replication and produces high quality reconstructions of the bonafide images used to create the morphs. Moreover, our method is highly generalizable across demorphing paradigms (differential/reference-free). We conduct experiments on AMSL, FRLL-Morphs and MorDiff datasets to showcase the efficacy of our method.",

    "title": "Test-Time Adaptation of 3D Point Clouds via Denoising Diffusion Models",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14495v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) of 3D point clouds is crucial for mitigating discrepancies between training and testing samples in real-world scenarios, particularly when handling corrupted point clouds. LiDAR data, for instance, can be affected by sensor failures or environmental factors, causing domain gaps. Adapting models to these distribution shifts online is crucial, as training for every possible variation is impractical. Existing methods often focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models based on self-supervised learning or pseudo-labeling, which can lead to forgetting valuable source domain knowledge over time and reduce generalization on future tests. In this paper, we introduce a novel 3D test-time adaptation method, termed 3DD-TTA, which stands for 3D Denoising Diffusion Test-Time Adaptation. This method uses a diffusion strategy that adapts input point cloud samples to the source domain while keeping the source model parameters intact. The approach uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to encode the corrupted point cloud into a shape latent and latent points. These latent points are corrupted with Gaussian noise and subjected to a denoising diffusion process. During this process, both the shape latent and latent points are updated to preserve fidelity, guiding the denoising toward generating consistent samples that align more closely with the source domain. We conduct extensive experiments on the ShapeNet dataset and investigate its generalizability on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Modern NAS techniques struggle to deal with ever increasing search space complexity and compute cost constraints. Existing approaches can be categorized into two buckets: fine-grained computational expensive NAS and coarse-grained low cost NAS. Our objective is to craft an algorithm with the capability to perform fine-grain NAS at a low cost. We propose projecting the problem to a lower dimensional space through predicting the difference in accuracy of a pair of similar networks. This paradigm shift allows for reducing computational complexity from exponential down to linear with respect to the size of the search space.

We propose a U-Structured multiscale inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs layer-wise explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates both higher and lower-scale motion features, in addition to the information of current and previous frames, to enable accurate motion estimation at the current scale. In addition, we design a cascaded spatial predictive coding module to capture the inter-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We further propose an effective context detach and restore scheme to reduce spatial-temporal redundancy in the motion and latent bit-streams and improve compression performance.

To accommodate varying lighting conditions, existing 3DGS extensions apply color mapping to the massive Gaussian primitives with individually optimized appearance embeddings. To handle occlusions, they predict pixel-wise uncertainties via 2D image features for occlusion capture. Nevertheless, such massive color mapping and pixel-wise uncertainty prediction strategies suffer from not only additional computational costs but also coarse-grained lighting and occlusion handling. In this work, we propose a nexus kernel-driven approach, termed NexusSplats, for efficient and finer 3D scene reconstruction under complex lighting and occlusion conditions. In particular, NexusSplats leverages a novel light decoupling strategy where appearance embeddings are optimized based on nexus kernels instead of massive Gaussian primitives, thus accelerating reconstruction speeds while ensuring local color consistency for finer textures. Additionally, a Gaussian-wise uncertainty mechanism is developed, aligning 3D structures with 2D image features for fine-grained occlusion handling. Experimental results demonstrate that NexusSplats achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing reconstruction time by up to 70.4% compared to the current best in quality.",

We examine the raw unnormalized embedding and show that text and image reside on linearly separable ellipsoid shells, not centered at the origin. We explain the benefits of having this structure, allowing to better embed instances according to their uncertainty during contrastive training. Frequent concepts in the dataset yield more false negatives, inducing greater uncertainty. A new notion of conformity is introduced, which measures the average cosine similarity of an instance to any other instance within a representative data set. We show this measure can be accurately estimated by simply computing the cosine similarity to the modality mean vector.

Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20$\\sim$40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), which combines a global aging prior with a personal photo collection (using as few as 50 images) to learn a personalized age transformation. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our approach can also be extended to videos, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and temporally consistent aging effects that resemble actual appearances at target ages, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.",

Supervised methods have achieved decent accuracy, but have a closed vocabulary and limited language understanding ability. Zero-shot methods mostly utilize large language models (LLMs) to handle natural language descriptions, yet suffer from slow inference speed. To address these problems, in this work, we propose a zero-shot method that reformulates the 3DVG task as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where the variables and constraints represent objects and their spatial relations, respectively. This allows a global reasoning of all relevant objects, producing grounding results of both the target and anchor objects. Moreover, we demonstrate the flexibility of our framework by handling negation- and counting-based queries with only minor extra coding efforts.

However, existing models are tailored to specific tasks, accommodating only one modality at a time and necessitating retraining to change modalities. Given an image-to-3D model and a text prompt, a naive approach is to convert text prompts to images and then use the image-to-3D model for generation. This approach is both time-consuming and labor-intensive, resulting in unavoidable information loss during modality conversion. To address this, we introduce XBind, a unified framework for any-to-3D generation using cross-modal pre-alignment techniques. XBind integrates an multimodal-aligned encoder with pre-trained diffusion models to generate 3D objects from any modalities, including text, images, and audio. We subsequently present a novel loss function, termed Modality Similarity (MS) Loss, which aligns the embeddings of the modality prompts and the rendered images, facilitating improved alignment of the 3D objects with multiple modalities. Additionally, Hybrid Diffusion Supervision combined with a Three-Phase Optimization process improves the quality of the generated 3D objects. Extensive experiments showcase XBind's broad generation capabilities in any-to-3D scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first method to generate 3D objects from any modality prompts.

But these two-stage approaches often suffer from high computational costs, memory inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose ESC-Net, a novel one-stage open-vocabulary segmentation model that leverages the SAM decoder blocks for class-agnostic segmentation within an efficient inference framework. By embedding pseudo prompts generated from image-text correlations into SAM's promptable segmentation framework, ESC-Net achieves refined spatial aggregation for accurate mask predictions. ESC-Net achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks, including ADE20K, PASCAL-VOC, and PASCAL-Context, outperforming prior methods in both efficiency and accuracy.

In this work, we focus on a unified and robust evaluation of \\textbf{vision perception} abilities, the foundational skill of MLLMs. We find that existing perception benchmarks, each focusing on different question types, domains, and evaluation metrics, introduce significant evaluation variance, complicating comprehensive assessments of perception abilities when relying on any single benchmark. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{AbilityLens}, a unified benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs across six key perception abilities, focusing on both accuracy and stability, with each ability encompassing diverse question types, domains, and metrics. With the assistance of AbilityLens, we: (1) identify the strengths and weaknesses of current models, highlighting stability patterns and revealing a notable performance gap between open-source and closed-source models; (2) introduce an online evaluation mode, which uncovers interesting ability conflict and early convergence phenomena during MLLM training; and (3) design a simple ability-specific model merging method that combines the best ability checkpoint from early training stages, effectively mitigating performance decline due to ability conflict.

In this study, we introduce a robust methodology to ascertain the most impactful features in fashion product images, utilizing past market sales data. First, we propose the metric called \"influence score\" to quantitatively assess the importance of product features. Then we develop a forecasting model, the Fashion Demand Predictor (FDP), which integrates Transformer-based models and Random Forest to predict market popularity based on product images. We employ image-editing diffusion models to modify these images and perform an ablation study, which validates the impact of the highest and lowest-scoring features on the model's popularity predictions. Additionally, we further validate these results through surveys that gather human rankings of preferences, confirming the accuracy of the FDP model's predictions and the efficacy of our method in identifying influential features. Notably, products enhanced with \"good\" features show marked improvements in predicted popularity over their modified counterparts. Our approach develops a fully automated and systematic framework for fashion image analysis that provides valuable guidance for downstream tasks such as fashion product design and marketing strategy development.",

Instead, we focus on the fundamental problem of learning in the UV texture space itself. For the first time, we train a large diffusion model capable of directly generating high-resolution texture maps in a feed-forward manner. To facilitate efficient learning in high-resolution UV spaces, we propose a scalable network architecture that interleaves convolutions on UV maps with attention layers on point clouds. Leveraging this architectural design, we train a 700 million parameter diffusion model that can generate UV texture maps guided by text prompts and single-view images.

A key challenge in this paradigm stems from the inherent disparity between the limited training set of whole slide images (WSIs) and the enormous number of contained patches, where a significant portion of these patches lacks diagnostically relevant information, potentially diluting the model's ability to learn and focus on critical diagnostic features. While recent works attempt to address this by incorporating additional knowledge, several crucial gaps hinder further progress: (1) despite the emergence of powerful pathology foundation models (FMs), their potential remains largely untapped, with most approaches limiting their use to basic feature extraction; (2) current language guidance mechanisms attempt to align text prompts with vast numbers of WSI patches all at once, struggling to leverage rich pathological semantic information. To this end, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced adaptive visual compression framework, dubbed FOCUS, which uniquely combines pathology FMs with language prior knowledge to enable a focused analysis of diagnostically relevant regions by prioritizing discriminative WSI patches. Our approach implements a progressive three-stage compression strategy: we first leverage FMs for global visual redundancy elimination, and integrate compressed features with language prompts for semantic relevance assessment, then perform neighbor-aware visual token filtering while preserving spatial coherence. Extensive experiments on pathological datasets spanning breast, lung, and ovarian cancers demonstrate its superior performance in few-shot pathology diagnosis.

Instead, researchers are focusing on online vectorized HDMap construction using on-board sensors. However, sensor-only approaches still face challenges in long-range perception due to the restricted views imposed by the mounting angles of onboard cameras, just as human drivers also rely on bird's-eye-view navigation maps for a comprehensive understanding of road structures. To address these issues, we propose to train the perception model to \"see\" standard definition maps (SDMaps). We encode SDMap elements into neural spatial map representations and instance tokens, and then incorporate such complementary features as prior information to improve the bird's eye view (BEV) feature for lane geometry and topology decoding. Based on the lane segment representation framework, the model simultaneously predicts lanes, centrelines and their topology. To further enhance the ability of geometry prediction and topology reasoning, we also use a topology-guided decoder to refine the predictions by exploiting the mutual relationships between topological and geometric features. We perform extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 datasets to validate the proposed method. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with gains of +6.7 and +9.1 on the mAP and topology metrics.

One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled $(x,y,t)$ coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128$\\times$128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.",

Drawing on advancements in weather forecasting models, this study introduces a cost-efficient downscaling method using a pretrained Earth Vision Transformer (Earth ViT) model. Initially trained on ERA5 data to downscale from 50 km to 25 km resolution, the model is then tested on the higher resolution BARRA-SY dataset at a 3 km resolution. Remarkably, it performs well without additional training, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different resolutions. This approach holds promise for generating large ensembles of regional climate simulations by downscaling GCMs with varying input resolutions without incurring additional training costs. Ultimately, this method could provide more comprehensive estimates of potential future changes in key climate variables, aiding in effective planning for extreme weather events and climate change adaptation strategies.",

Existing methods heavily rely on the supervision of labeled datasets to extract viewpoint-invariant features for cross-view retrieval. However, these methods have expensive training costs and tend to overfit the region-specific cues, showing limited generalizability to new regions. To overcome this issue, we propose an unsupervised solution that lifts the scene representation to 3d space from UAV observations for satellite image generation, providing robust representation against view distortion. By generating orthogonal images that closely resemble satellite views, our method reduces view discrepancies in feature representation and mitigates shortcuts in region-specific image pairing. To further align the rendered image's perspective with the real one, we design an iterative camera pose updating mechanism that progressively modulates the rendered query image with potential satellite targets, eliminating spatial offsets relative to the reference images. Additionally, this iterative refinement strategy enhances cross-view feature invariance through view-consistent fusion across iterations. As such, our unsupervised paradigm naturally avoids the problem of region-specific overfitting, enabling generic CVGL for UAV images without feature fine-tuning or data-driven training. Experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves geo-localization accuracy while maintaining robustness across diverse regions.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14823v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Image manipulation can lead to misinterpretation of visual content, posing significant risks to information security. Image Manipulation Localization (IML) has thus received increasing attention. However, existing IML methods rely heavily on task-specific designs, making them perform well only on one target image type but are mostly random guessing on other image types, and even joint training on multiple image types causes significant performance degradation. This hinders the deployment for real applications as it notably increases maintenance costs and the misclassification of image types leads to serious error accumulation. To this end, we propose Omni-IML, the first generalist model to unify diverse IML tasks. Specifically, Omni-IML achieves generalism by adopting the Modal Gate Encoder and the Dynamic Weight Decoder to adaptively determine the optimal encoding modality and the optimal decoder filters for each sample. We additionally propose an Anomaly Enhancement module that enhances the features of tampered regions with box supervision and helps the generalist model to extract common features across different IML tasks. We validate our approach on IML tasks across three major scenarios: natural images, document images, and face images. Without bells and whistles, our Omni-IML achieves state-of-the-art performance on all three tasks with a single unified model, providing valuable strategies and insights for real-world application and future research in generalist image forensics.

Existing solutions typically characterize a domain by solving a regression or classification problem, which limits their applicability as they only provide a limited summarized description of the domain. In this paper, we present a novel approach to domain characterization by characterizing domains as probability distributions. Particularly, we develop a method to predict the likelihood of different weather conditions from images captured by vehicle-mounted cameras by estimating distributions of physical parameters using normalizing flows. To validate our proposed approach, we conduct experiments within the context of autonomous vehicles, focusing on predicting the distribution of weather parameters to characterize the operational domain. This domain is characterized by physical parameters (absolute characterization) and arbitrarily predefined domains (relative characterization). Finally, we evaluate whether a system can safely operate in a target domain by comparing it to multiple source domains where safety has already been established. This approach holds significant potential, as accurate weather prediction and effective domain adaptation are crucial for autonomous systems to adjust to dynamic environmental conditions.",

While human observers can readily identify subtle visual details and perform accurate analyses, our investigation reveals that state-of-the-art LVLMs exhibit consistent limitations in specific visual graph scenarios, especially when confronted with stylistic variations. In response to these challenges, we introduce VisGraphVar (Visual Graph Variability), a customizable benchmark generator able to produce graph images for seven distinct task categories (detection, classification, segmentation, pattern recognition, link prediction, reasoning, matching), designed to systematically evaluate the strengths and limitations of individual LVLMs. We use VisGraphVar to produce 990 graph images and evaluate six LVLMs, employing two distinct prompting strategies, namely zero-shot and chain-of-thought. The findings demonstrate that variations in visual attributes of images (e.g., node labeling and layout) and the deliberate inclusion of visual imperfections, such as overlapping nodes, significantly affect model performance.

While existing approaches mainly rely on processing full-length multi-view videos for 4D reconstruction, there has been limited exploration of iterative online reconstruction methods that enable on-the-fly training and per-frame streaming. Current 3DGS-based streaming methods treat the Gaussian primitives uniformly and constantly renew the densified Gaussians, thereby overlooking the difference between dynamic and static features and also neglecting the temporal continuity in the scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage pipeline for iterative streamable 4D dynamic spatial reconstruction. Our pipeline comprises a selective inheritance stage to preserve temporal continuity, a dynamics-aware shift stage for distinguishing dynamic and static primitives and optimizing their movements, and an error-guided densification stage to accommodate emerging objects. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in online 4D reconstruction, demonstrating a 20% improvement in on-the-fly training speed, superior representation quality, and real-time rendering capability.

In this paper, we tackle this problem with Schrodinger Bridges (SBs), which are stochastic differential equations (SDEs) between distributions with minimal transport cost. We analyze the probability flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) formulation of SBs, and observe that we can decompose its vector field into a linear combination of source predictor, target predictor, and noise predictor. Inspired by this observation, we propose Latent Schrodinger Bridges (LSBs) that approximate the SB ODE via pre-trained Stable Diffusion, and develop appropriate prompt optimization and change of variables formula to match the training and inference between distributions. We demonstrate that our algorithm successfully conduct competitive I2I translation in unsupervised setting with only a fraction of computation cost required by previous DM-based I2I methods.",

A key challenge is the sparsity of preference labels, which are typically available only at the terminal of denoising trajectories. This raises the issue of how to assign credit across denoising steps based on these sparse labels. In this paper, we propose Denoised Distribution Estimation (DDE), a novel method for credit assignment. Unlike previous approaches that rely on auxiliary models or hand-crafted schemes, DDE derives its strategy more explicitly. The proposed DDE directly estimates the terminal denoised distribution from the perspective of each step. It is equipped with two estimation strategies and capable of representing the entire denoising trajectory with a single model inference. Theoretically and empirically, we show that DDE prioritizes optimizing the middle part of the denoising trajectory, resulting in a novel and effective credit assignment scheme.

Previous approaches face challenges such as high computational demands, training instability, and limited effectiveness with high-dimensional data, potentially leading to the loss of valuable features. To address these issues, we hypothesize that an ideal generalized representation should exhibit similar pattern responses within the same channel across cross-domain images. Based on this hypothesis, we use deep features from the source domain as queries, and deep features from the generated domain as keys and values. Through a cross-channel attention mechanism, the original deep features are reconstructed into robust regularization representations, forming an explicit constraint that guides the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Additionally, style augmentation is another common method. However, existing methods typically generate new styles through convex combinations of source domains, which limits the diversity of training samples by confining the generated styles to the original distribution. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Adaptive Feature Blending (AFB) method that generates out-of-distribution samples while exploring the in-distribution space, significantly expanding the domain range. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve superior performance on two standard domain generalization benchmarks for medical image segmentation.",

However, this task is hindered by significant challenges, including incomplete perception caused by occluded objects and observational blind spots, which are common in single-vehicle perception systems. To address these issues, we introduce LET-VIC, a LiDAR-based End-to-End Tracking framework for Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperation (VIC). LET-VIC leverages Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enhance temporal perception by fusing spatial and temporal data from both vehicle and infrastructure sensors. First, it spatially integrates Bird's Eye View (BEV) features from vehicle-side and infrastructure-side LiDAR data, creating a comprehensive view that mitigates occlusions and compensates for blind spots. Second, LET-VIC incorporates temporal context across frames, allowing the model to leverage historical data for enhanced tracking stability and accuracy. To further improve robustness, LET-VIC includes a Calibration Error Compensation (CEC) module to address sensor misalignments and ensure precise feature alignment. Experiments on the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that LET-VIC significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving at least a 13.7% improvement in mAP and a 13.1% improvement in AMOTA without considering communication delays.

With the rise of transformer architecture as visual backbones of choice, there exists now a great variety of different combinations of these two components, ranging all along the trade-off between detection quality and inference time. Facing this variety, practitioners in the field often have to spend a considerable amount of time on researching the right combination for their use-case at hand.

However, 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians, creating a large memory footprint. Moreover, they struggle to represent flat surfaces, as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers, they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues, we introduce a novel method, named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS), which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians, allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer, 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360, Tanks and Temples, and Deep Blending. Specifically, our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives.

But its point clouds are still sparse and noisy, making it challenging to meet the requirements of autonomous driving. Camera, as another commonly used sensor, can capture rich semantic information. As a result, the fusion of 4D radar and camera can provide an affordable and robust perception solution for autonomous driving systems. However, previous radar-camera fusion methods have not yet been thoroughly investigated, resulting in a large performance gap compared to LiDAR-based methods. Specifically, they ignore the feature-blurring problem and do not deeply interact with image semantic information. To this end, we present a simple but effective multi-stage sampling fusion (MSSF) network based on 4D radar and camera. On the one hand, we design a fusion block that can deeply interact point cloud features with image features, and can be applied to commonly used single-modal backbones in a plug-and-play manner. The fusion block encompasses two types, namely, simple feature fusion (SFF) and multiscale deformable feature fusion (MSDFF). The SFF is easy to implement, while the MSDFF has stronger fusion abilities. On the other hand, we propose a semantic-guided head to perform foreground-background segmentation on voxels with voxel feature re-weighting, further alleviating the problem of feature blurring. Extensive experiments on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadset datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our MSSF.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.15018v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In the literature, it has been shown that the evolution of the known explicit 3D surface to the target one can be learned from 2D images using the instantaneous flow field, where the known and target 3D surfaces may largely differ in topology. We are interested in capturing 4D shapes whose topology changes largely over time. We encounter that the straightforward extension of the existing 3D-based method to the desired 4D case performs poorly.\n  In this work, we address the challenges in extending 3D neural evolution to 4D under large topological changes by proposing two novel modifications. More precisely, we introduce (i) a new architecture to discretize and encode the deformation and learn the SDF and (ii) a technique to impose the temporal consistency. (iii) Also, we propose a rendering scheme for color prediction based on Gaussian splatting. Furthermore, to facilitate learning directly from 2D images, we propose a learning framework that can disentangle the geometry and appearance from RGB images. This method of disentanglement, while also useful for the 4D evolution problem that we are concentrating on, is also novel and valid for static scenes. Our extensive experiments on various data provide awesome results and, most importantly, open a new approach toward reconstructing challenging scenes with significant topological changes and deformations.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.15024v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Video large language models (VLLMs) have significantly advanced recently in processing complex video content, yet their inference efficiency remains constrained because of the high computational cost stemming from the thousands of visual tokens generated from the video inputs. We empirically observe that, unlike single image inputs, VLLMs typically attend visual tokens from different frames at different decoding iterations, making a one-shot pruning strategy prone to removing important tokens by mistake. Motivated by this, we present DyCoke, a training-free token compression method to optimize token representation and accelerate VLLMs. DyCoke incorporates a plug-and-play temporal compression module to minimize temporal redundancy by merging redundant tokens across frames, and applies dynamic KV cache reduction to prune spatially redundant tokens selectively. It ensures high-quality inference by dynamically retaining the critical tokens at each decoding step. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DyCoke can outperform the prior SoTA counterparts, achieving 1.5X inference speedup, 1.4X memory reduction against the baseline VLLM, while still improving the performance, with no training.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.15028v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We propose a diffusion model-based approach, FloAtControlNet to generate cinemagraphs composed of animations of human clothing. We focus on human clothing like dresses, skirts and pants. The input to our model is a text prompt depicting the type of clothing and the texture of clothing like leopard, striped, or plain, and a sequence of normal maps that capture the underlying animation that we desire in the output. The backbone of our method is a normal-map conditioned ControlNet which is operated in a training-free regime. The key observation is that the underlying animation is embedded in the flow of the normal maps. We utilize the flow thus obtained to manipulate the self-attention maps of appropriate layers. Specifically, the self-attention maps of a particular layer and frame are recomputed as a linear combination of itself and the self-attention maps of the same layer and the previous frame, warped by the flow on the normal maps of the two frames. We show that manipulating the self-attention maps greatly enhances the quality of the clothing animation, making it look more natural as well as suppressing the background artifacts. Through extensive experiments, we show that the method proposed beats all baselines both qualitatively in terms of visual results and user study. Specifically, our method is able to alleviate the background flickering that exists in other diffusion model-based baselines that we consider. In addition, we show that our method beats all baselines in terms of RMSE and PSNR computed using the input normal map sequences and the normal map sequences obtained from the output RGB frames. Further, we show that well-established evaluation metrics like LPIPS, SSIM, and CLIP scores that are generally for visual quality are not necessarily suitable for capturing the subtle motions in human clothing animations.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework,termed SPAC-Net, that aims to rethink the completion task under the guidance of a new structural prior, we call it interface. Specifically, our method first investigates Marginal Detector (MAD) module to localize the interface, defined as the intersection between the known observation and the missing parts. Based on the interface, our method predicts the coarse shape by learning the displacement from the points in interface move to their corresponding position in missing parts. Furthermore, we devise an additional Structure Supplement(SSP) module before the upsampling stage to enhance the structural details of the coarse shape, enabling the upsampling module to focus more on the upsampling task.

However, the resulting face meshes often need further processing: we need to stabilize them to remove unwanted head movement. Stabilization is important for tasks like game development or movie making which require facial expressions to be cleanly separated from rigid head motion. Since manual stabilization is labor-intensive, there have been attempts to automate it. However, previous methods remain impractical: they either still require some manual input, produce imprecise alignments, rely on dubious heuristics and slow optimization, or assume a temporally ordered input. Instead, we present a new learning-based approach that is simple and fully automatic. We treat stabilization as a regression problem: given two face meshes, our network directly predicts the rigid transform between them that brings their skulls into alignment. We generate synthetic training data using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), exploiting the fact that 3DMM parameters separate skull motion from facial skin motion. Through extensive experiments we show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantitatively and qualitatively on the tasks of stabilizing discrete sets of facial expressions as well as dynamic facial performances. Furthermore, we provide an ablation study detailing the design choices and best practices to help others adopt our approach for their own uses.

To this end, we propose InstAlign, a method that incorporates object-level reasoning into the segmentation process. Our model leverages both text and image inputs to extract a set of object-level tokens that capture both the semantic information in the input prompt and the objects within the image.

This paper presents a pioneering study on post-training pruning of Stable Diffusion 2, addressing the critical need for model compression in text-to-image domain. Our study tackles the pruning techniques for the previously unexplored multi-modal generation models, and particularly examines the pruning impact on the textual component and the image generation component separately. We conduct a comprehensive comparison on pruning the model or the single component of the model in various sparsities. Our results yield previously undocumented findings. For example, contrary to established trends in language model pruning, we discover that simple magnitude pruning outperforms more advanced techniques in text-to-image context. Furthermore, our results show that Stable Diffusion 2 can be pruned to 38.5% sparsity with minimal quality loss, achieving a significant reduction in model size. We propose an optimal pruning configuration that prunes the text encoder to 47.5% and the diffusion generator to 35%. This configuration maintains image generation quality while substantially reducing computational requirements. In addition, our work uncovers intriguing questions about information encoding in text-to-image models: we observe that pruning beyond certain thresholds leads to sudden performance drops (unreadable images), suggesting that specific weights encode critical semantics information. This finding opens new avenues for future research in model compression, interoperability, and bias identification in text-to-image models.

However, the numerous denoising steps in the robotic diffusion policy and the more dynamic, open-world nature of traffic scenes pose substantial challenges for generating diverse driving actions at a real-time speed.

However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and >87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14515v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Anomaly detection (AD) is a machine learning task that identifies anomalies by learning patterns from normal training data. In many real-world scenarios, anomalies vary in severity, from minor anomalies with little risk to severe abnormalities requiring immediate attention. However, existing models primarily operate in a binary setting, and the anomaly scores they produce are usually based on the deviation of data points from normal data, which may not accurately reflect practical severity. In this paper, we address this gap by making three key contributions. First, we propose a novel setting, Multilevel AD (MAD), in which the anomaly score represents the severity of anomalies in real-world applications, and we highlight its diverse applications across various domains. Second, we introduce a novel benchmark, MAD-Bench, that evaluates models not only on their ability to detect anomalies, but also on how effectively their anomaly scores reflect severity. This benchmark incorporates multiple types of baselines and real-world applications involving severity. Finally, we conduct a comprehensive performance analysis on MAD-Bench. We evaluate models on their ability to assign severity-aligned scores, investigate the correspondence between their performance on binary and multilevel detection, and study their robustness. This analysis offers key insights into improving AD models for practical severity alignment. The code framework and datasets used for the benchmark will be made publicly available.",

It is generally assumed that once deployed, the training data remains secure, as adversaries are limited to query response interactions with the model, where at best, fragments of arbitrary data can be inferred without any guarantees on their authenticity. In this paper, we propose the memory backdoor attack, where a model is covertly trained to memorize specific training samples and later selectively output them when triggered with an index pattern. What makes this attack unique is that it (1) works even when the tasks conflict (making a classifier output images), (2) enables the systematic extraction of training samples from deployed models and (3) offers guarantees on the extracted authenticity of the data. We demonstrate the attack on image classifiers, segmentation models, and a large language model (LLM). We demonstrate the attack on image classifiers, segmentation models, and a large language model (LLM). With this attack, it is possible to hide thousands of images and texts in modern vision architectures and LLMs respectively, all while maintaining model performance.

By far, CT images have contributed to the largest publicly available datasets for volumetric medical segmentation tasks, covering full-body anatomical structures. Large amounts of full-body CT images provide the opportunity to pre-train powerful models, e.g., STU-Net pre-trained in a supervised fashion, to segment numerous anatomical structures. However, it remains unclear in which conditions these pre-trained models can be transferred to various downstream medical segmentation tasks, particularly segmenting the other modalities and diverse targets. To address this problem, a large-scale benchmark for comprehensive evaluation is crucial for finding these conditions. Thus, we collected 87 public datasets varying in modality, target, and sample size to evaluate the transfer ability of full-body CT pre-trained models. We then employed a representative model, STU-Net with multiple model scales, to conduct transfer learning across modalities and targets. Our experimental results show that (1) there may be a bottleneck effect concerning the dataset size in fine-tuning, with more improvement on both small- and large-scale datasets than medium-size ones. (2) Models pre-trained on full-body CT demonstrate effective modality transfer, adapting well to other modalities such as MRI. (3) Pre-training on the full-body CT not only supports strong performance in structure detection but also shows efficacy in lesion detection, showcasing adaptability across target tasks.

To this end, we selected representative underwater image enhancement models covering major enhancement categories and applied them separately to two recent datasets: 1) the Real-World Underwater Object Detection Dataset (RUOD), and 2) the Challenging Underwater Plant Detection Dataset (CUPDD). Following this, we conducted qualitative and quantitative analyses on the enhanced images and developed a quality index (Q-index) to compare the quality distribution of the original and enhanced images. Subsequently, we compared the performance of several YOLO-NAS detection models that are separately trained and tested on the original and enhanced image sets. Then, we performed a correlation study to examine the relationship between enhancement metrics and detection performance. We also analyzed the inference results from the trained detectors presenting cases where enhancement increased the detection performance as well as cases where enhancement revealed missed objects by human annotators.

Despite the widespread use of representational comparisons and the abundance classes of comparison methods, a critical question remains: which metrics are most suitable for these comparisons? While some studies evaluate metrics based on their ability to differentiate models of different origins or constructions (e.g., various architectures), another approach is to assess how well they distinguish models that exhibit distinct behaviors. To investigate this, we examine the degree of alignment between various representational similarity measures and behavioral outcomes, employing group statistics and a comprehensive suite of behavioral metrics for comparison. In our evaluation of eight commonly used representational similarity metrics in the visual domain -- spanning alignment-based, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)-based, inner product kernel-based, and nearest-neighbor methods -- we found that metrics like linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Procrustes distance, which emphasize the overall geometric structure or shape of representations, excelled in differentiating trained from untrained models and aligning with behavioral measures, whereas metrics such as linear predictivity, commonly used in neuroscience, demonstrated only moderate alignment with behavior.

Underexposed endoscopic images often suffer from reduced contrast and uneven brightness, significantly impacting diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Internal body imaging is challenging due to uneven lighting and shadowy regions. Enhancing such images is essential since precise image interpretation is crucial for patient outcomes. In this paper, we introduce BrightVAE, an architecture based on the hierarchical Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (hierarchical VQ-VAE) tailored explicitly for enhancing luminosity in low-light endoscopic images. Our architecture is meticulously designed to tackle the unique challenges inherent in endoscopic imaging, such as significant variations in illumination and obscured details due to poor lighting conditions. The proposed model emphasizes advanced feature extraction from three distinct viewpoints-incorporating various receptive fields, skip connections, and feature attentions to robustly enhance image quality and support more accurate medical diagnoses. Through rigorous experimental analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques in enhancing low-light endoscopic images. To evaluate the performance of our architecture, we employ three widely recognized metrics-SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS-specifically on Endo4IE dataset, which consists of endoscopic images.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network (AGI-Net) that explores both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships for multimodal MR image synthesis. Specifically, groups are first pre-defined along the channel dimension and then we perform an adaptive rolling for the standard convolutional kernel to capture inter-modality spatial correspondences. At the same time, a cross-group attention module is introduced to fuse information across different channel groups, leading to better feature representation. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model on the publicly available IXI and BraTS2023 datasets, where the AGI-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance for multimodal MR image synthesis.

C-SLAM, as a fundamental technique for multiple service robots, needs to handle diverse challenges such as homogeneous scenes and dynamic objects to ensure that robots operate smoothly and perform their tasks safely.

We thus propose a novel negative supervised finetuning (nSFT) approach that fully excavates these information resided. Our nSFT disentangles this negative supervision in RLHF paradigm, and continually aligns VLMs with a simple SFT loss. This is more memory efficient than multimodal RLHF where 2 (e.g., DPO) or 4 (e.g., PPO) large VLMs are strictly required. The effectiveness of nSFT is rigorously proved by comparing it with various multimodal RLHF approaches, across different dataset sources, base VLMs and evaluation metrics.

Despite recent progress, the conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches not only heavily rely on detection or segmentation results as a prerequisite for the tracking stage, demanding plenty of refined segmentation masks, but are also deteriorated by imbalanced and long sequence data, leading to under-learning in training and missing cells in inference procedures. To alleviate the above issues, this paper proposes the novel end-to-end CAP framework, which leverages the idea of regarding Cell as Point to achieve efficient and stable cell tracking in one stage. CAP abandons detection or segmentation stages and simplifies the process by exploiting the correlation among the trajectories of cell points to track cells jointly, thus reducing the label demand and complexity of the pipeline. With cell point trajectory and visibility to represent cell locations and lineage relationships, CAP leverages the key innovations of adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling for addressing data imbalance in cell division events and the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference method to ensure continuous tracking of new cells in the long term. Eliminating the need for a prerequisite detection or segmentation stage, CAP demonstrates strong cell tracking performance while also being 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods.

Despite some research focusing on the robustness of optical flow models against adversarial attacks, there has been a lack of studies investigating their robustness to common corruptions. Taking into account the unique temporal characteristics of optical flow, we introduce 7 temporal corruptions specifically designed for benchmarking the robustness of optical flow models, in addition to 17 classical single-image corruptions, in which advanced PSF Blur simulation method is performed. Two robustness benchmarks, KITTI-FC and GoPro-FC, are subsequently established as the first corruption robustness benchmark for optical flow estimation, with Out-Of-Domain (OOD) and In-Domain (ID) settings to facilitate comprehensive studies. Robustness metrics, Corruption Robustness Error (CRE), Corruption Robustness Error ratio (CREr), and Relative Corruption Robustness Error (RCRE) are further introduced to quantify the optical flow estimation robustness. 29 model variants from 15 optical flow methods are evaluated, yielding 10 intriguing observations, such as 1) the absolute robustness of the model is heavily dependent on the estimation performance; 2) the corruptions that diminish local information are more serious than that reduce visual effects.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14967v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Audio description (AD) is a crucial accessibility service provided to blind persons and persons with visual impairment, designed to convey visual information in acoustic form. Despite recent advancements in multilingual machine translation research, the lack of well-crafted and time-synchronized AD data impedes the development of audio description translation (ADT) systems that address the needs of multilingual countries such as Switzerland. Furthermore, since the majority of ADT systems rely solely on text, uncertainty exists as to whether incorporating visual information from the corresponding video clips can enhance the quality of ADT outputs. In this work, we present SwissADT, the first ADT system implemented for three main Swiss languages and English. By collecting well-crafted AD data augmented with video clips in German, French, Italian, and English, and leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we aim to enhance information accessibility for diverse language populations in Switzerland by automatically translating AD scripts to the desired Swiss language. Our extensive experimental ADT results, composed of both automatic and human evaluations of ADT quality, demonstrate the promising capability of SwissADT for the ADT task. We believe that combining human expertise with the generation power of LLMs can further enhance the performance of ADT systems, ultimately benefiting a larger multilingual target population.",

The bigger these systems are, the more complex are the phenomena they can detect, and the more data they need for this. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly ubiquitous in our society, and its impact is growing everyday. The promises it holds strongly depend on their fair and universal use, such as access to information or education for all. In a world of inequalities, they can help to reach the most disadvantaged areas. However, such a universal systems must be able to represent society, without benefiting some at the expense of others. We must not reproduce the inequalities observed throughout the world, but educate these IAs to go beyond them. We have seen cases where these systems use gender, race, or even class information in ways that are not appropriate for resolving their tasks. Instead of real causal reasoning, they rely on spurious correlations, which is what we usually call a bias. In this paper, we first attempt to define what is a bias in general terms. It helps us to demystify the concept of bias, to understand why we can find them everywhere and why they are sometimes useful. Second, we focus over the notion of what is generally seen as negative bias, the one we want to avoid in machine learning, before presenting a general zoology containing the most common of these biases. We finally conclude by looking at classical methods to detect them, by means of specially crafted datasets of templates and specific algorithms, and also classical methods to mitigate them.",

Next, we introduce a scalable, post-hoc hallucination detection method that identifies a Neural Hallucination Precursor (NHP) from VS model embeddings for test-time detection. We report extensive validation across diverse and challenging VS settings to demonstrate NHP's effectiveness and robustness.

To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that aligns gene and image features using a ranking-based alignment loss, preserving relative similarity across modalities and enabling robust multi-scale alignment. To further enhance the alignment's stability, we employ self-supervised knowledge distillation with a teacher-student network architecture, effectively mitigating disruptions from high dimensionality, sparsity, and noise in gene expression data.

This manual process demands high accuracy and is often time-consuming, costly, and error-prone. Automated image segmentation using artificial intelligence offers a promising alternative to streamline this workflow. However, most existing methods are supervised, requiring large, expertly annotated datasets that are not always available, and they experience significant generalization issues. Thus, unsupervised learning models can be leveraged for image segmentation, but they come at a cost of reduced accuracy, or require extensive computational resourcess. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end quantum-enhanced framework for unsupervised mammography medical images segmentation that balances between performance accuracy and computational requirements. We first introduce a quantum-inspired image representation that serves as an initial approximation of the segmentation mask. The segmentation task is then formulated as a QUBO problem, aiming to maximize the contrast between the background and the tumor region while ensuring a cohesive segmentation mask with minimal connected components. We conduct an extensive evaluation of quantum and quantum-inspired methods for image segmentation, demonstrating that quantum annealing and variational quantum circuits achieve performance comparable to classical optimization techniques. Notably, quantum annealing is shown to be an order of magnitude faster than the classical optimization method in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate that this framework achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods, including UNet-based architectures, offering a viable unsupervised alternative for breast cancer image segmentation.",

We then establish that the optimal rate in $L^1$ is $n^{-1/(2+r)}$ which, compared to the standard nonparametric rate of $n^{-1/(2+d)}$, reveals that the effective dimension of such problems is the size of the largest clique in the Markov random field. These rates are independent of the data's ambient dimension, making them applicable to realistic models of image, sound, video, and text data. Our results provide a novel justification for deep learning's ability to circumvent the curse of dimensionality, demonstrating dimension-independent convergence rates in these contexts.",

However, the need for large amounts of labelled data remains a challenge. Semi-supervised learning offers a way to overcome this limitation, allowing models to learn from a small amount of labelled data along with a large unlabelled dataset. While semi-supervised learning has shown promise in FER, most current methods from general computer vision literature have not been explored in the context of FER. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on 11 of the most recent semi-supervised methods, in the context of FER, namely Pi-model, Pseudo-label, Mean Teacher, VAT, UDA, MixMatch, ReMixMatch, FlexMatch, CoMatch, and CCSSL. Our investigation covers semi-supervised learning from in-distribution, out-of-distribution, unconstrained, and very small unlabelled data. Our evaluation includes five FER datasets plus one large face dataset for unconstrained learning. Our results demonstrate that FixMatch consistently achieves better performance on in-distribution unlabelled data, while ReMixMatch stands out among all methods for out-of-distribution, unconstrained, and scarce unlabelled data scenarios. Another significant observation is that with an equal number of labelled samples, semi-supervised learning delivers a considerable improvement over supervised learning, regardless of whether the unlabelled data is in-distribution, out-of-distribution, or unconstrained.

Our NDM can learn to densify a sparse cardiac point cloud with arbitrary scales and generate high-quality triangular meshes automatically. It also enables the implicit learning of dense correspondences among different heart shape instances for accurate cardiac shape registration. Furthermore, the parameters of NDM are intuitive, and can be used by a physician without sophisticated post-processing.

Our interest in this paper is to determine if the Segment Anything model (SAM) can contribute to this task. We investigate two models for combining SAM with optical flow that harness the segmentation power of SAM with the ability of flow to discover and group moving objects. In the first model, we adapt SAM to take optical flow, rather than RGB, as an input. In the second, SAM takes RGB as an input, and flow is used as a segmentation prompt. These surprisingly simple methods, without any further modifications, outperform all previous approaches by a considerable margin in both single and multi-object benchmarks.

To achieve this, some recent works have been proposed to simultaneously forecast hand trajectories and object affordances on human egocentric videos. The joint prediction serves as a comprehensive representation of future hand-object interactions in 2D space, indicating potential human motion and motivation. However, the existing approaches mostly adopt the autoregressive paradigm for unidirectional prediction, which lacks mutual constraints within the holistic future sequence, and accumulates errors along the time axis. Meanwhile, these works basically overlook the effect of camera egomotion on first-person view predictions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel diffusion-based interaction prediction method, namely Diff-IP2D, to forecast future hand trajectories and object affordances concurrently in an iterative non-autoregressive manner. We transform the sequential 2D images into latent feature space and design a denoising diffusion model to predict future latent interaction features conditioned on past ones. Motion features are further integrated into the conditional denoising process to enable Diff-IP2D aware of the camera wearer's dynamics for more accurate interaction prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines on both the off-the-shelf metrics and our newly proposed evaluation protocol.

The core principle of SEP involves adapting the learnable prompt tokens at each encoder layer from the corresponding self-pretrained tokens, thereby explicitly incorporating discriminative prior knowledge to enhance both textual-level and visual-level embeddings. Furthermore, SEP's self-enhanced tokens not only boost discrimination but also mitigate domain shifts in unseen domains, enhancing generalization. In practice, SEP selects several representative tokens from all pre-trained tokens for each input data at every layer of the text/visual encoders. Subsequently, a Token Fusion Module (TFM) is introduced to generate a self-enhanced token by merging these representative tokens with the learnable tokens using a cross-attention mechanism. This self-enhanced token is then concatenated with all pre-trained tokens, serving as input for subsequent encoder layers to produce the relevant embeddings. Comprehensive evaluations across various benchmarks and tasks confirm SEP's efficacy in prompt tuning. Code: \\href{Code}{https://github.com/htyao89/SEP}.",

Existing methods primarily address image enhancement with approaches that hinge on storing the full-size input. In contrast, we introduce the Capsule Enhanced Variational AutoEncoder (CE-VAE), a novel architecture designed to efficiently compress and enhance degraded underwater images. Our attention-aware image encoder can project the input image onto a latent space representation while being able to run online on a remote device. The only information that needs to be stored on the device or sent to a beacon is a compressed representation. There is a dual-decoder module that performs offline, full-size enhanced image generation. One branch reconstructs spatial details from the compressed latent space, while the second branch utilizes a capsule-clustering layer to capture entity-level structures and complex spatial relationships. This parallel decoding strategy enables the model to balance fine-detail preservation with context-aware enhancements. CE-VAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image enhancement on six benchmark datasets, providing up to 3x higher compression efficiency than existing approaches.

This paper introduces the Mesh-adsorbed Gaussian Splatting (MaGS) method to address this challenge. MaGS constrains 3D Gaussians to roam near the mesh, creating a mutually adsorbed mesh-Gaussian 3D representation. Such representation harnesses both the rendering flexibility of 3D Gaussians and the structured property of meshes. To achieve this, we introduce RMD-Net, a network that learns motion priors from video data to refine mesh deformations, alongside RGD-Net, which models the relative displacement between the mesh and Gaussians to enhance rendering fidelity under mesh constraints. To generalize to novel, user-defined deformations beyond input video without reliance on temporal data, we propose MPE-Net, which leverages inherent mesh information to bootstrap RMD-Net and RGD-Net. Due to the universality of meshes, MaGS is compatible with various deformation priors such as ARAP, SMPL, and soft physics simulation. Extensive experiments on the D-NeRF, DG-Mesh, and PeopleSnapshot datasets demonstrate that MaGS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruction and simulation.",

However, these reconstructions often suffer from one or both of the following limitations: First, they typically represent scenes in low dynamic range (LDR), which restricts their use to evenly lit environments and hinders immersive viewing experiences. Secondly, their reliance on a pinhole camera model, assuming all scene elements are in focus in the input images, presents practical challenges and complicates refocusing during novel-view synthesis. Addressing these limitations, we present a lightweight method based on 3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes multi-view LDR images of a scene with varying exposure times, apertures, and focus distances as input to reconstruct a high-dynamic-range (HDR) radiance field. By incorporating analytical convolutions of Gaussians based on a thin-lens camera model as well as a tonemapping module, our reconstructions enable the rendering of HDR content with flexible refocusing capabilities. We demonstrate that our combined treatment of HDR and depth of field facilitates real-time cinematic rendering, outperforming the state of the art.",

We model the underlying manifold of these weights as a subspace, which we term weights2weights. We demonstrate three immediate applications of this space that result in new diffusion models -- sampling, editing, and inversion. First, sampling a set of weights from this space results in a new model encoding a novel identity. Next, we find linear directions in this space corresponding to semantic edits of the identity (e.g., adding a beard), resulting in a new model with the original identity edited. Finally, we show that inverting a single image into this space encodes a realistic identity into a model, even if the input image is out of distribution (e.g., a painting). We further find that these linear properties of the diffusion model weight space extend to other visual concepts. Our results indicate that the weight space of fine-tuned diffusion models can behave as an interpretable meta-latent space producing new models.",

However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a task demonstration that may contain inefficiencies or mistakes, a VLM abstracts the trajectory into a generalized program of thoughts by correcting inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: causal relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task-relevant visual elements. These programs of thought are iteratively improved through human feedback while the agent executes the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting examples significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Moreover, as the agent's library of examples grows, it becomes more efficient, relying less on human feedback and requiring fewer environment interactions per demonstration. Our ICAL agent surpasses the SOTA in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over few-shot GPT4V. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on manual prompt engineering and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such programs of thought.",

The model we developed, Confidence Assessment for enhanced Semantic segmentation (CAS), evaluates confidence at both the segment and pixel levels, providing both labels and confidence scores as output. Our model, CAS, identifies segments with incorrect predicted labels using the proposed combined confidence metric, refines the model, and enhances its performance.

This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.",

To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy. The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts. However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting. While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images. In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts. Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment. The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks.

For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties.

Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns.

The encoder utilizes shifted window self-attention across five resolutions to extract multi-scale features, which are then propagated to the decoder through skip connections. We introduce an augmented multi-layer perceptron within the encoder to explicitly model long-range dependencies during feature extraction. Recognizing the constraints of conventional symmetrical encoder-decoder designs, we propose an Adaptive Feature Fusion (AFF) decoder to complement our encoder. This decoder incorporates three key components: the Long Range Dependencies (LRD) block, the Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MFF) block, and the Adaptive Semantic Center (ASC) block. These components synergistically facilitate the effective fusion of multi-scale features extracted by the decoder while capturing long-range dependencies and refining object boundaries. Comprehensive experiments on diverse medical image segmentation tasks, including multi-organ, liver tumor, and bladder tumor segmentation, demonstrate that ASSNet achieves state-of-the-art results.

    "summary": "arXiv:2409.16845v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recently, computer-aided design models and electromagnetic simulations have been used to augment synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for deep learning. However, an automatic target recognition (ATR) model struggles with domain shift when using synthetic data because the model learns specific clutter patterns present in such data, which disturbs performance when applied to measured data with different clutter distributions. This study proposes a framework particularly designed for domain-generalized SAR-ATR called IRASNet, enabling effective feature-level clutter reduction and domain-invariant feature learning. First, we propose a clutter reduction module (CRM) that maximizes the signal-to-clutter ratio on feature maps. The module reduces the impact of clutter at the feature level while preserving target and shadow information, thereby improving ATR performance. Second, we integrate adversarial learning with CRM to extract clutter-reduced domain-invariant features. The integration bridges the gap between synthetic and measured datasets without requiring measured data during training. Third, we improve feature extraction from target and shadow regions by implementing a positional supervision task using mask ground truth encoding. The improvement enhances the ability of the model to discriminate between classes. Our proposed IRASNet presents new state-of-the-art public SAR datasets utilizing target and shadow information to achieve superior performance across various test conditions. IRASNet not only enhances generalization performance but also significantly improves feature-level clutter reduction, making it a valuable advancement in the field of radar image pattern recognition.",

We note that the input text description typically already contains detailed information on how to localize the target object, and we also observe that humans often follow a step-by-step comprehension process (\\ie, progressively utilizing target-related attributes and relations as cues) to identify the target object. Hence, we propose a novel Progressive Comprehension Network (PCNet) to leverage target-related textual cues from the input description for progressively localizing the target object. Specifically, we first use a Large Language Model (LLM) to decompose the input text description into short phrases. These short phrases are taken as target-related cues and fed into a Conditional Referring Module (CRM) in multiple stages, to allow updating the referring text embedding and enhance the response map for target localization in a multi-stage manner. Based on the CRM, we then propose a Region-aware Shrinking (RaS) loss to constrain the visual localization to be conducted progressively in a coarse-to-fine manner across different stages. Finally, we introduce an Instance-aware Disambiguation (IaD) loss to suppress instance localization ambiguity by differentiating overlapping response maps generated by different referring texts on the same image.

Current acceleration methods, whether training-based or training-free, often lead to significant performance degradation, highlighting the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we identify two primary factors contributing to performance degradation: fitting errors and the inference gap. Our key insight is that fitting errors can be mitigated by linearly extrapolating the incorrect score functions, while the inference gap can be reduced by shifting the Gaussian flow to a reflectance-aware residual space. Based on the above insights, we design Reflectance-Aware Trajectory Refinement (RATR) module, a simple yet effective module to refine the teacher trajectory using the reflectance component of images.

The significant domain gap between the source and target datasets leads to a sharp decline in the performance of existing few-shot segmentation (FSS) methods in cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we discover an intriguing phenomenon: simply filtering different frequency components for target domains can lead to a significant performance improvement, sometimes even as high as 14% mIoU. Then, we delve into this phenomenon for an interpretation, and find such improvements stem from the reduced inter-channel correlation in feature maps, which benefits CD-FSS with enhanced robustness against domain gaps and larger activated regions for segmentation. Based on this, we propose a lightweight frequency masker, which further reduces channel correlations by an Amplitude-Phase Masker (APM) module and an Adaptive Channel Phase Attention (ACPA) module. Notably, APM introduces only 0.01% additional parameters but improves the average performance by over 10%, and ACPA imports only 2.5% parameters but further improves the performance by over 1.5%, which significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art CD-FSS methods.",

However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization ability to novel views. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem, presenting a Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. Our method encompasses a $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and a $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model. The $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model serves as an ensemble of 3DGS models that generates novel-view images during inference. We achieve the self-ensembling by introducing an uncertainty-aware perturbation strategy at the training state. We complement the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model with the $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model, which is dynamically perturbed based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps. The perturbation yields diverse temporal samples in the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and these temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of 3DGS models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model. Our experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

Our method's qualitative and quantitative improvements over 3D and 2D Gaussians are most noticeable when fewer primitives are used, when BBSplat achieves over 1200 FPS. Our novel regularization term encourages textures to have a sparser structure, unlocking an efficient compression that leads to a reduction in storage space of the model. Our experiments show the efficiency of BBSplat on standard datasets of real indoor and outdoor scenes such as Tanks&Temples, DTU, and Mip-NeRF-360.

This paper introduces a saliency map-based image retrieval approach using invariant Krawtchouk moments (SM-IKM) to enhance retrieval speed and accuracy. The proposed method applies a global contrast-based salient region detection algorithm to create a saliency map that effectively isolates the foreground from the background. It then combines multiple orders of invariant Krawtchouk moments (IKM) with local binary patterns (LBPs) and color histograms to comprehensively represent the foreground and background. Additionally, it incorporates LBPs derived from the saliency map to improve discriminative power, facilitating more precise image differentiation. A bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) model is employed to generate a codebook for classification and discrimination. By using compact IKMs in the BoVW framework and integrating a range of region-based feature-including color histograms, LBPs, and saliency map-enhanced LBPs, our proposed SM-IKM achieves efficient and accurate image retrieval. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets, such as Caltech 101 and Wang, demonstrate that SM-IKM outperforms recent state-of-the-art retrieval methods.

There is great interest in making this data more useful by further labeling it with additional trait data, and modern deep learning machine learning techniques utilizing convolutional neural nets (CNNs) and similar networks show particular promise to reduce the amount of required manual labeling by human experts, making the process much faster and less expensive. However, in most cases, the accuracy of these approaches is too low for reliable utilization of the automatic labeling, typically in the range of 80-85% accuracy. In this paper, we present and validate an approach that can greatly improve this accuracy, essentially by examining the confidence that the network has in the generated label as well as utilizing a user-defined threshold to reject labels that fall below a chosen level. We demonstrate that a naive model that produced 86% initial accuracy can achieve improved performance - over 95% accuracy (rejecting about 40% of the labels) or over 99% accuracy (rejecting about 65%) by selecting higher confidence thresholds. This gives flexibility to adapt existing models to the statistical requirements of various types of research and has the potential to move these automatic labeling approaches from being unusably inaccurate to being an invaluable new tool. After validating the approach in a number of ways, we annotate the reproductive state of a large dataset of over 600,000 herbarium specimens. The analysis of the results points at under-investigated correlations as well as general alignment with known trends.

Additionally, we introduce frequency-domain learning by customizing a frequency distance loss to enhance high-frequency garment details. To tackle the size-aware fitting issue, we employ a dilated-relaxed mask strategy that adapts to the correct length of garments, preventing the generation of garments that fill the entire mask area during cross-category try-on. Equipped with the above design, FitDiT surpasses all baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Based on this, our framework is designed as a Triplet Diffusion for Skeleton-Text Matching (TDSM) method which aligns skeleton features with text prompts through reverse diffusion, embedding the prompts into the unified skeleton-text latent space to achieve robust matching. To enhance discriminative power, we introduce a novel triplet diffusion (TD) loss that encourages our TDSM to correct skeleton-text matches while pushing apart incorrect ones.

In light of this, we are dedicated to fulfilling the unprecedented intelligence (compression) capacity of the LLM for lossless image compression tasks, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical and practical compression performance.

Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud analysis datasets.

OpenStreetMap is the result of 11 million registered users manually annotating the GPS location of over 1.75 billion entries, including distinctive landmarks and common urban objects. At the same time, manual annotations can include errors and are slow to update, limiting the map's accuracy. Maps from Motion (MfM) is a step forward to automatize such time-consuming map making procedure by computing 2D maps of semantic objects directly from a collection of uncalibrated multi-view images. From each image, we extract a set of object detections, and estimate their spatial arrangement in a top-down local map centered in the reference frame of the camera that captured the image. Aligning these local maps is not a trivial problem, since they provide incomplete, noisy fragments of the scene, and matching detections across them is unreliable because of the presence of repeated pattern and the limited appearance variability of urban objects. We address this with a novel graph-based framework, that encodes the spatial and semantic distribution of the objects detected in each image, and learns how to combine them to predict the objects' poses in a global reference system, while taking into account all possible detection matches and preserving the topology observed in each image. Despite the complexity of the problem, our best model achieves global 2D registration with an average accuracy within 4 meters (i.e., below GPS accuracy) even on sparse sequences with strong viewpoint change, on which COLMAP has an 80% failure rate.

This forms the basis of ControlNets or Adapters. When attempting to apply these methods to control human poses in outputs of text-to-image diffusion models, two main challenges have arisen. The first challenge is generating poses following a wide range of semantic text descriptions, for which previous methods involved searching for a pose within a dataset of (caption, pose) pairs. The second challenge is conditioning image generation on a specified pose while keeping both high aesthetic and high pose fidelity. In this article, we fix these two main issues by introducing a text-to-pose (T2P) generative model alongside a new sampling algorithm, and a new pose adapter that incorporates more pose keypoints for higher pose fidelity. Together, these two new state-of-the-art models enable, for the first time, a generative text-to-pose-to-image framework for higher pose control in diffusion models. We release all models and the code used for the experiments at https://github.com/clement-bonnet/text-to-pose.",

Previous methods primarily focus on complex training strategies to utilize unlabeled data but neglect the importance of graph structural information. Different from existing methods, we propose a graph-based clustering for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (GraphCL) by jointly modeling graph data structure in a unified deep model. The proposed GraphCL model enjoys several advantages. Firstly, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model the data structure information for semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS). Secondly, to get the clustered features across different graphs, we integrate both pairwise affinities between local image features and raw features as inputs.

A key advantage of SSDA is its ability to significantly reduce reliance on labeled data, thereby lowering the costs and time associated with data preparation. Most existing SSDA methods utilize information from domain labels and class labels but overlook the structural information of the data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a graph learning perspective (AGLP) for semi-supervised domain adaptation. We apply the graph convolutional network to the instance graph which allows structural information to propagate along the weighted graph edges. The proposed AGLP model has several advantages. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to model structural information in SSDA. Second, the proposed model can effectively learn domain-invariant and semantic representations, reducing domain discrepancies in SSDA. Extensive experimental results on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed AGLP algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised domain adaptation methods.",

Few studies have concentrated on taking the textual instruction into improving visual representation, resulting in losing focus in some vision-centric tasks, a phenomenon we herein termed as Amblyopia. In this work, we introduce Panther, a MLLM that closely adheres to user instruction and locates targets of interests precisely, with the finesse of a black panther. Specifically, Panther comprises three integral components: Panther-VE, Panther-Bridge, and Panther-Decoder. Panther-VE integrates user instruction information at the early stages of the vision encoder, thereby extracting the most relevant and useful visual representations. The Panther-Bridge module, equipped with powerful filtering capabilities, significantly reduces redundant visual information, leading to a substantial savings in training costs. The Panther-Decoder is versatile and can be employed with any decoder-only architecture of LLMs without discrimination.

Network quantization, as a standard compression and acceleration technique, reduces storage costs and enables potential inference acceleration by discretizing network weights and activations into a finite set of integer values. However, current quantization methods are often complex and sensitive, requiring extensive task-specific hyperparameters, where even a single misconfiguration can impair model performance, limiting generality across different models and tasks. In this paper, we propose Quantization without Tears (QwT), a method that simultaneously achieves quantization speed, accuracy, simplicity, and generality. The key insight of QwT is to incorporate a lightweight additional structure into the quantized network to mitigate information loss during quantization. This structure consists solely of a small set of linear layers, keeping the method simple and efficient. More importantly, it provides a closed-form solution, allowing us to improve accuracy effortlessly under 2 minutes. Extensive experiments across various vision, language, and multimodal tasks demonstrate that QwT is both highly effective and versatile. In fact, our approach offers a robust solution for network quantization that combines simplicity, accuracy, and adaptability, which provides new insights for the design of novel quantization paradigms.",

Figuring out the properties of such polytopes is of fundamental importance for the research and development of neural networks. So far, either theoretical or empirical studies on polytopes only stay at the level of counting their number, which is far from a complete characterization. Here, we propose to study the shapes of polytopes via the number of faces of the polytope. Then, by computing and analyzing the histogram of faces across polytopes, we find that a ReLU network has relatively simple polytopes under both initialization and gradient descent, although these polytopes can be rather diverse and complicated by a specific design. This finding can be appreciated as a kind of generalized implicit bias, subjected to the intrinsic geometric constraint in space partition of a ReLU network. Next, we perform a combinatorial analysis to explain why adding depth does not generate a more complicated polytope by bounding the average number of faces of polytopes with the dimensionality. Our results concretely reveal what kind of simple functions a network learns and what will happen when a network goes deep. Also, by characterizing the shape of polytopes, the number of faces can be a novel leverage for other problems, \\textit{e.g.}, serving as a generic tool to explain the power of popular shortcut networks such as ResNet and analyzing the impact of different regularization strategies on a network's space partition.",

Our approach includes three core components: a text-conditional semantic synthesizer for creating realistic full-torso anatomies; a contrast-aware autoencoder for detailed, high-fidelity feature extraction across varying contrast levels; and a latent feature generator that ensures alignment between CT images, anatomical semantics and input prompts. To train and evaluate GuideGen, we compile a multi-modality cancer imaging dataset with paired CT and clinical descriptions from 12 public TCIA datasets and one private real-world dataset. Comprehensive evaluations across generation quality, cross-modality alignment, and data usability on multi-organ and tumor segmentation tasks demonstrate GuideGen's superiority over existing CT generation methods.",

Federated learning (FL) offers a promising solution to scale up the dataset for medical VLP while preserving data privacy. However, we observe that client data heterogeneity in real-world scenarios could cause models to learn biased cross-modal alignment during local pre-training. This would limit the transferability of the federally learned representation model on downstream tasks. To address this challenge, we propose Federated Distributionally Robust Alignment (FedDRA), a framework for federated VLP that achieves robust vision-language alignment under heterogeneous conditions. Based on client datasets, we construct a distribution family that encompasses potential test-time domains, and apply a distributionally robust framework to optimize the pre-trained model's performance across this distribution space. This approach bridges the gap between pre-training samples and downstream applications. To avoid over-fitting on client-specific information, we use anchor representation from the global model to guide the local training, and adopt a two-stage approach to first tune deeper layers before updating the entire network. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate FedDRA's effectiveness in enhancing medical federated VLP under data heterogeneity.

Considering their importance in these architectures, a complete comparative evaluation of different triplet loss functions is performed. The experimental section proves that triplet networks can be trained with a relatively low number of images captured under a specific lighting condition and even so, the resulting networks are a robust tool to perform visual localization under dynamic conditions. Our approach has been evaluated against some of these effects, such as changes in the lighting conditions, occlusions, noise and motion blurring.

Defensive watermarking enables GenAI providers to hide fingerprints in their images and use them later for deepfake detection. Yet, its potential has not been fully explored. We present UnMarker -- the first practical universal attack on defensive watermarking. Unlike existing attacks, UnMarker requires no detector feedback, no unrealistic knowledge of the watermarking scheme or similar models, and no advanced denoising pipelines that may not be available. Instead, being the product of an in-depth analysis of the watermarking paradigm revealing that robust schemes must construct their watermarks in the spectral amplitudes, UnMarker employs two novel adversarial optimizations to disrupt the spectra of watermarked images, erasing the watermarks. Evaluations against SOTA schemes prove UnMarker's effectiveness. It not only defeats traditional schemes while retaining superior quality compared to existing attacks but also breaks semantic watermarks that alter an image's structure, reducing the best detection rate to $43\\%$ and rendering them useless. To our knowledge, UnMarker is the first practical attack on semantic watermarks, which have been deemed the future of defensive watermarking. Our findings show that defensive watermarking is not a viable defense against deepfakes, and we urge the community to explore alternatives.",

To address this issue, we develop constrained diffusion models by imposing diffusion constraints based on desired distributions that are informed by requirements. Specifically, we cast the training of diffusion models under requirements as a constrained distribution optimization problem that aims to reduce the distribution difference between original and generated data while obeying constraints on the distribution of generated data. We show that our constrained diffusion models generate new data from a mixture data distribution that achieves the optimal trade-off among objective and constraints. To train constrained diffusion models, we develop a dual training algorithm and characterize the optimality of the trained constrained diffusion model. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our constrained models in two constrained generation tasks: (i) we consider a dataset with one or more underrepresented classes where we train the model with constraints to ensure fairly sampling from all classes during inference; (ii) we fine-tune a pre-trained diffusion model to sample from a new dataset while avoiding overfitting.",

However, their theoretical capabilities, particularly in terms of generalization when trained to overfit training data, are still not fully understood. To address this gap, this work delves deeply into the benign overfitting perspective of transformers in vision. To this end, we study the optimization of a Transformer composed of a self-attention layer with softmax followed by a fully connected layer under gradient descent on a certain data distribution model. By developing techniques that address the challenges posed by softmax and the interdependent nature of multiple weights in transformer optimization, we successfully characterized the training dynamics and achieved generalization in post-training. Our results establish a sharp condition that can distinguish between the small test error phase and the large test error regime, based on the signal-to-noise ratio in the data model.

We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data.

    "title": "Adversarial Poisoning Attack on Quantum Machine Learning Models",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.14412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: With the growing interest in Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and the increasing availability of quantum computers through cloud providers, addressing the potential security risks associated with QML has become an urgent priority. One key concern in the QML domain is the threat of data poisoning attacks in the current quantum cloud setting. Adversarial access to training data could severely compromise the integrity and availability of QML models. Classical data poisoning techniques require significant knowledge and training to generate poisoned data, and lack noise resilience, making them ineffective for QML models in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. In this work, we first propose a simple yet effective technique to measure intra-class encoder state similarity (ESS) by analyzing the outputs of encoding circuits. Leveraging this approach, we introduce a quantum indiscriminate data poisoning attack, QUID. Through extensive experiments conducted in both noiseless and noisy environments (e.g., IBM\\_Brisbane's noise), across various architectures and datasets, QUID achieves up to $92\\%$ accuracy degradation in model performance compared to baseline models and up to $75\\%$ accuracy degradation compared to random label-flipping. We also tested QUID against state-of-the-art classical defenses, with accuracy degradation still exceeding $50\\%$, demonstrating its effectiveness. This work represents the first attempt to reevaluate data poisoning attacks in the context of QML.",

    "title": "Adapting Vision Foundation Models for Robust Cloud Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images",
    "summary": "Cloud segmentation is a critical challenge in remote sensing image interpretation, as its accuracy directly impacts the effectiveness of subsequent data processing and analysis. Recently, vision foundation models (VFM) have demonstrated powerful generalization capabilities across various visual tasks. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient adaptive approach, termed Cloud-Adapter, designed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of cloud segmentation. Our method leverages a VFM pretrained on general domain data, which remains frozen, eliminating the need for additional training. Cloud-Adapter incorporates a lightweight spatial perception module that initially utilizes a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) to extract dense spatial representations. These multi-scale features are then aggregated and serve as contextual inputs to an adapting module, which modulates the frozen transformer layers within the VFM. Experimental results demonstrate that the Cloud-Adapter approach, utilizing only 0.6% of the trainable parameters of the frozen backbone, achieves substantial performance gains. Cloud-Adapter consistently attains state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across a wide variety of cloud segmentation datasets from multiple satellite sources, sensor series, data processing levels, land cover scenarios, and annotation granularities. We have released the source code and pretrained models at https://github.com/XavierJiezou/Cloud-Adapter to support further research.",

    "summary": "Recent text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities across various domains. However, these models often generate videos that have misalignments with text prompts, especially when the prompts describe complex scenes with multiple objects and attributes. To address this, we introduce VideoRepair, a novel model-agnostic, training-free video refinement framework that automatically identifies fine-grained text-video misalignments and generates explicit spatial and textual feedback, enabling a T2V diffusion model to perform targeted, localized refinements. VideoRepair consists of four stages: In (1) video evaluation, we detect misalignments by generating fine-grained evaluation questions and answering those questions with MLLM. In (2) refinement planning, we identify accurately generated objects and then create localized prompts to refine other areas in the video. Next, in (3) region decomposition, we segment the correctly generated area using a combined grounding module. We regenerate the video by adjusting the misaligned regions while preserving the correct regions in (4) localized refinement. On two popular video generation benchmarks (EvalCrafter and T2V-CompBench), VideoRepair substantially outperforms recent baselines across various text-video alignment metrics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of VideoRepair components and qualitative examples.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) possess extensive knowledge and exhibit promising reasoning abilities; however, they still struggle to perform well in complex, dynamic environments. Real-world tasks require handling intricate interactions, advanced spatial reasoning, long-term planning, and continuous exploration of new strategies-areas in which we lack effective methodologies for comprehensively evaluating these capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce BALROG, a novel benchmark designed to assess the agentic capabilities of LLMs and VLMs through a diverse set of challenging games. Our benchmark incorporates a range of existing reinforcement learning environments with varying levels of difficulty, including tasks that are solvable by non-expert humans in seconds to extremely challenging ones that may take years to master (e.g., the NetHack Learning Environment). We devise fine-grained metrics to measure performance and conduct an extensive evaluation of several popular open-source and closed-source LLMs and VLMs. Our findings indicate that while current models achieve partial success in the easier games, they struggle significantly with more challenging tasks. Notably, we observe severe deficiencies in vision-based decision-making, as models perform worse when visual representations of the environments are provided. We release BALROG as an open and user-friendly benchmark to facilitate future research and development in the agentic community.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) lead to significant breakthroughs in both academia and industry. One question that arises is how we, as humans, can understand their internal neural representations. This paper takes an initial step towards addressing this question by presenting a versatile framework to identify and interpret the semantics within LMMs. Specifically, 1) we first apply a Sparse Autoencoder(SAE) to disentangle the representations into human understandable features. 2) We then present an automatic interpretation framework to interpreted the open-semantic features learned in SAE by the LMMs themselves. We employ this framework to analyze the LLaVA-NeXT-8B model using the LLaVA-OV-72B model, demonstrating that these features can effectively steer the model's behavior. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of why LMMs excel in specific tasks, including EQ tests, and illuminate the nature of their mistakes along with potential strategies for their rectification. These findings offer new insights into the internal mechanisms of LMMs and suggest parallels with the cognitive processes of the human brain.",

    "summary": "In recent years, research in the area of human-robot interaction has focused on developing robots capable of understanding complex human instructions and performing tasks in dynamic and diverse environments. These systems have a wide range of applications, from personal assistance to industrial robotics, emphasizing the importance of robots interacting flexibly, naturally and safely with humans. This paper presents an advanced architecture for robotic action planning that integrates communication, perception, and planning with Large Language Models (LLMs). Our system is designed to translate commands expressed in natural language into executable robot actions, incorporating environmental information and dynamically updating plans based on real-time feedback. The Planner Module is the core of the system where LLMs embedded in a modified ReAct framework are employed to interpret and carry out user commands. By leveraging their extensive pre-trained knowledge, LLMs can effectively process user requests without the need to introduce new knowledge on the changing environment. The modified ReAct framework further enhances the execution space by providing real-time environmental perception and the outcomes of physical actions. By combining robust and dynamic semantic map representations as graphs with control components and failure explanations, this architecture enhances a robot adaptability, task execution, and seamless collaboration with human users in shared and dynamic environments. Through the integration of continuous feedback loops with the environment the system can dynamically adjusts the plan to accommodate unexpected changes, optimizing the robot ability to perform tasks. Using a dataset of previous experience is possible to provide detailed feedback about the failure. Updating the LLMs context of the next iteration with suggestion on how to overcame the issue.",

    "title": "VideoEspresso: A Large-Scale Chain-of-Thought Dataset for Fine-Grained Video Reasoning via Core Frame Selection",
    "summary": "The advancement of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has significantly improved multimodal understanding, yet challenges remain in video reasoning tasks due to the scarcity of high-quality, large-scale datasets. Existing video question-answering (VideoQA) datasets often rely on costly manual annotations with insufficient granularity or automatic construction methods with redundant frame-by-frame analysis, limiting their scalability and effectiveness for complex reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce VideoEspresso, a novel dataset that features VideoQA pairs preserving essential spatial details and temporal coherence, along with multimodal annotations of intermediate reasoning steps. Our construction pipeline employs a semantic-aware method to reduce redundancy, followed by generating QA pairs using GPT-4o. We further develop video Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations to enrich reasoning processes, guiding GPT-4o in extracting logical relationships from QA pairs and video content. To exploit the potential of high-quality VideoQA pairs, we propose a Hybrid LVLMs Collaboration framework, featuring a Frame Selector and a two-stage instruction fine-tuned reasoning LVLM. This framework adaptively selects core frames and performs CoT reasoning using multimodal evidence. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark with 14 tasks against 9 popular LVLMs, our method outperforms existing baselines on most tasks, demonstrating superior video reasoning capabilities.

    "title": "A Flexible Large Language Models Guardrail Development Methodology Applied to Off-Topic Prompt Detection",
    "summary": "Large Language Models are prone to off-topic misuse, where users may prompt these models to perform tasks beyond their intended scope. Current guardrails, which often rely on curated examples or custom classifiers, suffer from high false-positive rates, limited adaptability, and the impracticality of requiring real-world data that is not available in pre-production. In this paper, we introduce a flexible, data-free guardrail development methodology that addresses these challenges. By thoroughly defining the problem space qualitatively and passing this to an LLM to generate diverse prompts, we construct a synthetic dataset to benchmark and train off-topic guardrails that outperform heuristic approaches. Additionally, by framing the task as classifying whether the user prompt is relevant with respect to the system prompt, our guardrails effectively generalize to other misuse categories, including jailbreak and harmful prompts. Lastly, we further contribute to the field by open-sourcing both the synthetic dataset and the off-topic guardrail models, providing valuable resources for developing guardrails in pre-production environments and supporting future research and development in LLM safety.",

    "title": "Efficient Long Video Tokenization via Coordinated-based Patch Reconstruction",
    "summary": "Efficient tokenization of videos remains a challenge in training vision models that can process long videos. One promising direction is to develop a tokenizer that can encode long video clips, as it would enable the tokenizer to leverage the temporal coherence of videos better for tokenization. However, training existing tokenizers on long videos often incurs a huge training cost as they are trained to reconstruct all the frames at once. In this paper, we introduce CoordTok, a video tokenizer that learns a mapping from coordinate-based representations to the corresponding patches of input videos, inspired by recent advances in 3D generative models. In particular, CoordTok encodes a video into factorized triplane representations and reconstructs patches that correspond to randomly sampled (x,y,t) coordinates. This allows for training large tokenizer models directly on long videos without requiring excessive training resources. Our experiments show that CoordTok can drastically reduce the number of tokens for encoding long video clips. For instance, CoordTok can encode a 128-frame video with 128times128 resolution into 1280 tokens, while baselines need 6144 or 8192 tokens to achieve similar reconstruction quality. We further show that this efficient video tokenization enables memory-efficient training of a diffusion transformer that can generate 128 frames at once.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce T\\\"ULU 3, a family of fully-open state-of-the-art post-trained models, alongside its data, code, and training recipes, serving as a comprehensive guide for modern post-training techniques. T\\\"ULU 3, which builds on Llama 3.1 base models, achieves results surpassing the instruct versions of Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, Mistral, and even closed models such as GPT-4o-mini and Claude 3.5-Haiku.

We conclude with analysis and discussion of training methods that did not reliably improve performance.

Quadruped robots with manipulators hold promise for extending the workspace and enabling robust locomotion, but existing results do not investigate such a capability. This paper proposes WildLMa with three components to address these issues: (1) adaptation of learned low-level controller for VR-enabled whole-body teleoperation and traversability; (2) WildLMa-Skill -- a library of generalizable visuomotor skills acquired via imitation learning or heuristics and (3) WildLMa-Planner -- an interface of learned skills that allow LLM planners to coordinate skills for long-horizon tasks. We demonstrate the importance of high-quality training data by achieving higher grasping success rate over existing RL baselines using only tens of demonstrations. WildLMa exploits CLIP for language-conditioned imitation learning that empirically generalizes to objects unseen in training demonstrations. Besides extensive quantitative evaluation, we qualitatively demonstrate practical robot applications, such as cleaning up trash in university hallways or outdoor terrains, operating articulated objects, and rearranging items on a bookshelf.",

By redesigning the SVD denoising process, ViewExtrapolator refines the artifact-prone views rendered by radiance fields, greatly enhancing the clarity and realism of the synthesized novel views. ViewExtrapolator is a generic novel view extrapolator that can work with different types of 3D rendering such as views rendered from point clouds when only a single view or monocular video is available. Additionally, ViewExtrapolator requires no fine-tuning of SVD, making it both data-efficient and computation-efficient.

    "summary": "Facial aging is a complex process, highly dependent on multiple factors like gender, ethnicity, lifestyle, etc., making it extremely challenging to learn a global aging prior to predict aging for any individual accurately. Existing techniques often produce realistic and plausible aging results, but the re-aged images often do not resemble the person's appearance at the target age and thus need personalization. In many practical applications of virtual aging, e.g. VFX in movies and TV shows, access to a personal photo collection of the user depicting aging in a small time interval (20sim40 years) is often available. However, naive attempts to personalize global aging techniques on personal photo collections often fail. Thus, we propose MyTimeMachine (MyTM), which combines a global aging prior with a personal photo collection (using as few as 50 images) to learn a personalized age transformation. We introduce a novel Adapter Network that combines personalized aging features with global aging features and generates a re-aged image with StyleGAN2. We also introduce three loss functions to personalize the Adapter Network with personalized aging loss, extrapolation regularization, and adaptive w-norm regularization. Our approach can also be extended to videos, achieving high-quality, identity-preserving, and temporally consistent aging effects that resemble actual appearances at target ages, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art approaches.",

At its core, OminiControl leverages a parameter reuse mechanism, enabling the DiT to encode image conditions using itself as a powerful backbone and process them with its flexible multi-modal attention processors. Unlike existing methods, which rely heavily on additional encoder modules with complex architectures, OminiControl (1) effectively and efficiently incorporates injected image conditions with only ~0.1% additional parameters, and (2) addresses a wide range of image conditioning tasks in a unified manner, including subject-driven generation and spatially-aligned conditions such as edges, depth, and more. Remarkably, these capabilities are achieved by training on images generated by the DiT itself, which is particularly beneficial for subject-driven generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OminiControl outperforms existing UNet-based and DiT-adapted models in both subject-driven and spatially-aligned conditional generation. Additionally, we release our training dataset, Subjects200K, a diverse collection of over 200,000 identity-consistent images, along with an efficient data synthesis pipeline to advance research in subject-consistent generation.",

We propose the Style-friendly SNR sampler, which aggressively shifts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distribution toward higher noise levels during fine-tuning to focus on noise levels where stylistic features emerge. This enables models to better capture unique styles and generate images with higher style alignment. Our method allows diffusion models to learn and share new \"style templates\", enhancing personalized content creation.
