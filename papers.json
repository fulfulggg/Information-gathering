    "title": "Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance for Point Cloud Completion and Beyond",
    "summary": "arXiv:2412.17951v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) is widely used as a metric to quantify difference between two point clouds. In point cloud completion, Chamfer Distance (CD) is typically used as a loss function in deep learning frameworks. However, it is generally acknowledged within the field that Chamfer Distance (CD) is vulnerable to the presence of outliers, which can consequently lead to the convergence on suboptimal models. In divergence from the existing literature, which largely concentrates on resolving such concerns in the realm of Euclidean space, we put forth a notably uncomplicated yet potent metric specifically designed for point cloud completion tasks: {Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance (HyperCD)}. This metric conducts Chamfer Distance computations within the parameters of hyperbolic space. During the backpropagation process, HyperCD systematically allocates greater weight to matched point pairs exhibiting reduced Euclidean distances. This mechanism facilitates the preservation of accurate point pair matches while permitting the incremental adjustment of suboptimal matches, thereby contributing to enhanced point cloud completion outcomes. Moreover, measure the shape dissimilarity is not solely work for point cloud completion task, we further explore its applications in other generative related tasks, including single image reconstruction from point cloud, and upsampling. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the point cloud completion benchmark datasets, PCN, ShapeNet-55, and ShapeNet-34, and show from visualization that HyperCD can significantly improve the surface smoothness, we also provide the provide experimental results beyond completion task.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.17957v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: $\\textit{ArchComplete}$ is a two-stage dense voxel-based 3D generative pipeline developed to tackle the high complexity in architectural geometries and topologies, assisting with ideation and geometric detailisation in the early design process. In stage 1, a $\\textit{3D Voxel VQGAN}$ model is devised, whose composition is then modelled with an autoregressive transformer for generating coarse models. Subsequently, in stage 2, $\\textit{Hierarchical Voxel Upsampling Networks}$ consisting of a set of 3D conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models are defined to augment the coarse shapes with fine geometric details. The first stage is trained on a dataset of house models with fully modelled exteriors and interiors with a novel 2.5D perceptual loss to capture input complexities across multiple abstraction levels, while the second stage trains on randomly cropped local volumetric patches, requiring significantly less compute and memory. For inference, the pipeline first autoregressively generates house models at a resolution of $64^3$ and then progressively refines them to resolution of $256^3$ with voxel sizes as small as $18\\text{cm}$. ArchComplete supports a range of interaction modes solving a variety of tasks, including interpolation, variation generation, unconditional synthesis, and two conditional synthesis tasks: shape completion and plan-drawing completion, as well as geometric detailisation. The results demonstrate notable improvements against state-of-the-art on established metrics.",

By combining data from Impact Echo (IE) and Ultrasonic Surface Waves (USW) methods, this preliminary investigation focuses on identifying defect-prone regions within concrete structures, emphasizing critical indicators such as delamination and debonding. Using geospatial analysis with alpha shapes, fusion of defect points, and unified lane boundaries, the proposed framework consolidates disparate data sources to enhance defect localization and facilitate the identification of overlapping defect regions. Cross-verification with adaptive image processing further validates detected defects by aligning their coordinates with visual data, utilizing advanced contour-based mapping and bounding box techniques for precise defect identification. The experimental results, with an F1 score of 0.83, demonstrate the potential efficacy of the approach in improving defect localization, reducing false positives, and enhancing detection accuracy, which provides a foundation for future research and larger-scale validation. This preliminary exploration establishes the framework as a promising tool for efficient bridge health assessment, with implications for proactive structural monitoring and maintenance.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.17982v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Spatially varying regularization accommodates the deformation variations that may be necessary for different anatomical regions during deformable image registration. Historically, optimization-based registration models have harnessed spatially varying regularization to address anatomical subtleties. However, most modern deep learning-based models tend to gravitate towards spatially invariant regularization, wherein a homogenous regularization strength is applied across the entire image, potentially disregarding localized variations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that integrates a prior distribution on the deformation regularization strength, enabling the end-to-end learning of a spatially varying deformation regularizer directly from the data. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and easily integrates with various registration network architectures. Additionally, automatic tuning of hyperparameters is achieved through Bayesian optimization, allowing efficient identification of optimal hyperparameters for any given registration task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves registration performance and enhances the interpretability of deep learning-based registration, all while maintaining smooth deformations.",

However, existing technologies encounter challenges due to modality biases and imbalances, as well as domain shifts. Our research introduces a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model to address these issues effectively. We identified three limitations in traditional MoE approaches to multimodal FAS: (1) Coarse-grained experts' inability to capture nuanced spoofing indicators; (2) Gated networks' susceptibility to input noise affecting decision-making; (3) MoE's sensitivity to prompt tokens leading to overfitting with conventional learning methods. To mitigate these, we propose the Bypass Isolated Gating MoE (BIG-MoE) framework, featuring: (1) Fine-grained experts for enhanced detection of subtle spoofing cues; (2) An isolation gating mechanism to counteract input noise; (3) A novel differential convolutional prompt bypass enriching the gating network with critical local features, thereby improving perceptual capabilities.

Despite the flexibility and accessibility of these models, no single model is able to handle all tasks and/or applications that may be envisioned by potential users. Recent approaches, such as visual programming and multimodal LLMs with integrated tools aim to tackle complex visual tasks, by way of program synthesis. However, such approaches overlook user constraints (e.g., performance / computational needs), produce test-time sample-specific solutions that are difficult to deploy, and, sometimes, require low-level instructions that maybe beyond the abilities of a naive user. To address these limitations, we introduce MMFactory, a universal framework that includes model and metrics routing components, acting like a solution search engine across various available models. Based on a task description and few sample input-output pairs and (optionally) resource and/or performance constraints, MMFactory can suggest a diverse pool of programmatic solutions by instantiating and combining visio-lingual tools from its model repository. In addition to synthesizing these solutions, MMFactory also proposes metrics and benchmarks performance / resource characteristics, allowing users to pick a solution that meets their unique design constraints. From the technical perspective, we also introduced a committee-based solution proposer that leverages multi-agent LLM conversation to generate executable, diverse, universal, and robust solutions for the user. Experimental results show that MMFactory outperforms existing methods by delivering state-of-the-art solutions tailored to user problem specifications.

In contrast, multimodal object detection tasks can offer more comprehensive information about object features by integrating data from various modalities. Current multimodal object detection methods generally use various fusion techniques, including conventional neural networks and transformer-based models, to implement feature fusion strategies and achieve complementary information. However, since multimodal images are captured by different sensors, there are often misalignments between them, making direct matching challenging. This misalignment hinders the ability to establish strong correlations for the same object across different modalities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called the CrOss-Mamba interaction and Offset-guided fusion (COMO) framework for multimodal object detection tasks. The COMO framework employs the cross-mamba technique to formulate feature interaction equations, enabling multimodal serialized state computation. This results in interactive fusion outputs while reducing computational overhead and improving efficiency. Additionally, COMO leverages high-level features, which are less affected by misalignment, to facilitate interaction and transfer complementary information between modalities, addressing the positional offset challenges caused by variations in camera angles and capture times. Furthermore, COMO incorporates a global and local scanning mechanism in the cross-mamba module to capture features with local correlation, particularly in remote sensing images. To preserve low-level features, the offset-guided fusion mechanism ensures effective multiscale feature utilization, allowing the construction of a multiscale fusion data cube that enhances detection performance.",

To that end, we propose Dual Convoltuional Prompting (DCP) that learns to extract domain-specific features by localized prompting along both position and channel dimensions. DCP is designed as a plug-in module that can effectively turn a R2AU-Net based vessel segmentation network to a unified model, yet without the need of modifying its network structure. For evaluation we build a broad-domain set using five public domain-specific datasets including ROSSA, FIVES, IOSTAR, PRIME-FP20 and VAMPIRE.

The Open Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) is a challenging problem that arises when both of these issues occur together. Existing OSDA approaches in literature only align known classes or use supervised training to learn unknown classes as a single new category. In this work, we introduce a new approach to improve OSDA techniques by extracting a set of high-confidence unknown instances and using it as a hard constraint to tighten the classification boundaries. Specifically, we use a new loss constraint that is evaluated in three different ways: (1) using pristine negative instances directly; (2) using data augmentation techniques to create randomly transformed negatives; and (3) with generated synthetic negatives containing adversarial features. We analyze different strategies to improve the discriminator and the training of the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used to generate synthetic negatives.

While existing deep learning-based methods can achieve good detection results, they generally necessitate pixel-level annotations, which are notably challenging to acquire for hyperspectral images. To address this issue, we introduce point supervision into HSOD, and incorporate Spectral Saliency, derived from conventional HSOD methods, as a pivotal spectral representation within the framework. This integration leads to the development of a novel Spectrum-oriented Point-supervised Saliency Detector (SPSD). Specifically, we propose a novel pipeline, specifically designed for HSIs, to generate pseudo-labels, effectively mitigating the performance decline associated with point supervision strategy. Additionally, Spectral Saliency is employed to counteract information loss during model supervision and saliency refinement, thereby maintaining the structural integrity and edge accuracy of the detected objects. Furthermore, we introduce a Spectrum-transformed Spatial Gate to focus more precisely on salient regions while reducing feature redundancy. We have carried out comprehensive experiments on both HSOD-BIT and HS-SOD datasets to validate the efficacy of our proposed method, using mean absolute error (MAE), E-measure, F-measure, Area Under Curve, and Cross Correlation as evaluation metrics.

In this work, we propose a new T2I personalization diffusion model, Dense-Face, which can generate face images with a consistent identity as the given reference subject and align well with the text caption. Specifically, we introduce a pose-controllable adapter for the high-fidelity image generation while maintaining the text-based editing ability of the pre-trained stable diffusion (SD). Additionally, we use internal features of the SD UNet to predict dense face annotations, enabling the proposed method to gain domain knowledge in face generation.

Correspondingly, many automated metrics have emerged to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of generative models. However, the performance comparison among these automated metrics is limited by existing small datasets. Additionally, these datasets lack the capacity to assess the performance of automated metrics at a fine-grained level. In this study, we contribute an EvalMuse-40K benchmark, gathering 40K image-text pairs with fine-grained human annotations for image-text alignment-related tasks. In the construction process, we employ various strategies such as balanced prompt sampling and data re-annotation to ensure the diversity and reliability of our benchmark. This allows us to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of image-text alignment metrics for T2I models. Meanwhile, we introduce two new methods to evaluate the image-text alignment capabilities of T2I models: FGA-BLIP2 which involves end-to-end fine-tuning of a vision-language model to produce fine-grained image-text alignment scores and PN-VQA which adopts a novel positive-negative VQA manner in VQA models for zero-shot fine-grained evaluation. Both methods achieve impressive performance in image-text alignment evaluations. We also use our methods to rank current AIGC models, in which the results can serve as a reference source for future study and promote the development of T2I generation.

While CNNs excel at extracting multi-scale features and ViTs effectively capture global dependencies, both suffer from high computational costs, particularly when processing high-resolution images. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have attracted attention due to their efficiency. However, their performance in image classification tasks remains limited. To address these challenges, this paper introduces VisionGRU, a novel RNN-based architecture designed for efficient image classification. VisionGRU leverages a simplified Gated Recurrent Unit (minGRU) to process large-scale image features with linear complexity. It divides images into smaller patches and progressively reduces the sequence length while increasing the channel depth, thus facilitating multi-scale feature extraction. A hierarchical 2DGRU module with bidirectional scanning captures both local and global contexts, improving long-range dependency modeling, particularly for tasks like semantic segmentation. Experimental results on the ImageNet and ADE20K datasets demonstrate that VisionGRU outperforms ViTs, significantly reducing memory usage and computational costs, especially for high-resolution images.

There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks.

However, it remains challenging due to the distinct physical properties of these two types of data and the absence of effective fusion guidance.

Specifically, a band group prompting (BGP) strategy is introduced to align the visual representation effectively at the level of band groups, which also facilitates a more adequate extraction of semantic information of different bands with textual information. In addition, a multivariate supervised matrix (MSM) based training strategy is proposed to alleviate the problem of positive and negative sample confusion by completing the supervised information.

A recent study leverages the idea that VLMs implicitly learn compositional structures of semantic concepts within the image. Instead of using an individual region embedding, it utilizes a bag of region embeddings as a new representation to incorporate compositional structures into the OVD task. However, this approach often fails to capture the contextual concepts of each region, leading to noisy compositional structures. This results in only marginal performance improvements and reduced efficiency. To address this, we propose a novel concept-based alignment method that samples a more powerful and efficient compositional structure. Our approach groups contextually related ``concepts'' into a bag and adjusts the scale of concepts within the bag for more effective embedding alignment. Combined with Faster R-CNN, our method achieves improvements of 2.6 box AP50 and 0.5 mask AP over prior work on novel categories in the open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS benchmarks.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.18276v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: U-Net models with encoder, decoder, and skip-connections components have demonstrated effectiveness in a variety of vision tasks. The skip-connections transmit fine-grained information from the encoder to the decoder. It is necessary to maintain the feature maps used by the skip-connections in memory before the decoding stage. Therefore, they are not friendly to devices with limited resource. In this paper, we propose a universal method and architecture to reduce the memory consumption and meanwhile generate enhanced feature maps to improve network performance. To this end, we design a simple but effective Multi-Scale Information Aggregation Module (MSIAM) in the encoder and an Information Enhancement Module (IEM) in the decoder. The MSIAM aggregates multi-scale feature maps into single-scale with less memory. After that, the aggregated feature maps can be expanded and enhanced to multi-scale feature maps by the IEM. By applying the proposed method on NAFNet, a SOTA model in the field of image restoration, we design a memory-efficient and feature-enhanced network architecture, UNet--. The memory demand by the skip-connections in the UNet-- is reduced by 93.3%, while the performance is improved compared to NAFNet. Furthermore, we show that our proposed method can be generalized to multiple visual tasks, with consistent improvements in both memory consumption and network accuracy compared to the existing efficient architectures.",

However, real-world scenarios often present novel modalities that are unseen during training due to resource and privacy constraints, a challenge current methods struggle to address. This paper introduces Modality Generalization (MG), which focuses on enabling models to generalize to unseen modalities. We define two cases: weak MG, where both seen and unseen modalities can be mapped into a joint embedding space via existing perceptors, and strong MG, where no such mappings exist. To facilitate progress, we propose a comprehensive benchmark featuring multi-modal algorithms and adapt existing methods that focus on generalization. Extensive experiments highlight the complexity of MG, exposing the limitations of existing methods and identifying key directions for future research.

This paper delves into the pivotal influence of unseen class priors within the framework of transductive ZSL (TZSL) and illuminates the finding that even a marginal prior bias can result in substantial accuracy declines. Our extensive analysis uncovers that this inefficacy fundamentally stems from the utilization of an unconditional unseen discriminator - a core component in existing TZSL. We further establish that the detrimental effects of this component are inevitable unless the generator perfectly fits class-specific distributions. Building on these insights, we introduce our Improved Feature Generation Framework, termed I-VAEGAN, which incorporates two novel components: Pseudo-conditional Feature Adversarial (PFA) learning and Variational Embedding Regression (VER). PFA circumvents the need for prior estimation by explicitly injecting the predicted semantics as pseudo conditions for unseen classes premised by precise semantic regression. Meanwhile, VER utilizes reconstructive pre-training to learn class statistics, obtaining better semantic regression.

Recent studies reveal that attackers can embed biases into these models through simple fine-tuning, causing them to generate targeted imagery when triggered by specific phrases. This underscores the potential for T2I models to act as tools for disseminating propaganda, producing images aligned with an attacker's objective for end-users.\n  Building on this concept, we introduce FameBias, a T2I biasing attack that manipulates the embeddings of input prompts to generate images featuring specific public figures. Unlike prior methods, Famebias operates solely on the input embedding vectors without requiring additional model training. We evaluate FameBias comprehensively using Stable Diffusion V2, generating a large corpus of images based on various trigger nouns and target public figures.

In the fields of virtual reality, augmented reality and smart home, traditional input methods have gradually failed to meet the needs of users for interactive experience. As an intuitive and convenient interaction method, gestures have received more and more attention. This paper proposes a gesture recognition method based on a three-dimensional hand skeleton model. By simulating the three-dimensional spatial distribution of hand joints, a simplified hand skeleton structure is constructed. By connecting the palm and each finger joint, a dynamic and static gesture model of the hand is formed, which further improves the accuracy and efficiency of gesture recognition. Experimental results show that this method can effectively recognize various gestures and maintain high recognition accuracy and real-time response capabilities in different environments. In addition, combined with multimodal technologies such as eye tracking, the intelligence level of the gesture recognition system can be further improved, bringing a richer and more intuitive user experience.

Label noise can mislead model optimization, thereby exacerbating the challenges of open-set recognition in novel domains. In this study, we take the first step towards addressing Open-Set Domain Generalization under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL) by constructing dedicated benchmarks derived from widely used OSDG datasets, including PACS and DigitsDG. We evaluate baseline approaches by integrating techniques from both label denoising and OSDG methodologies, highlighting the limitations of existing strategies in handling label noise effectively.

In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel generative framework, the Recurrent Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RDPM), which enhances the diffusion process through a recurrent token prediction mechanism, thereby pioneering the field of Discrete Diffusion. By progressively introducing Gaussian noise into the latent representations of images and encoding them into vector-quantized tokens in a recurrent manner, RDPM facilitates a unique diffusion process on discrete-value domains. This process iteratively predicts the token codes for subsequent timesteps, transforming the initial standard Gaussian noise into the source data distribution, aligning with GPT-style models in terms of the loss function. RDPM demonstrates superior performance while benefiting from the speed advantage of requiring only a few inference steps. This model not only leverages the diffusion process to ensure high-quality generation but also converts continuous signals into a series of high-fidelity discrete tokens, thereby maintaining a unified optimization strategy with other discrete tokens, such as text. We anticipate that this work will contribute to the development of a unified model for multimodal generation, specifically by integrating continuous signal domains such as images, videos, and audio with text.

However, this approach may not fully capture the complex semantics within the images available in ImageNet, potentially hindering the development of models that effectively learn these intricacies. This study critically examines the prevalent single-label benchmarking approach and advocates for a shift to multi-label benchmarking for ImageNet. This shift would enable a more comprehensive assessment of the capabilities of deep neural network (DNN) models. We analyze the effectiveness of pre-trained state-of-the-art DNNs on ImageNet and one of its variants, ImageNetV2. Studies in the literature have reported unexpected accuracy drops of 11% to 14% on ImageNetV2. Our findings show that these reported declines are largely attributable to a characteristic of the dataset that has not received sufficient attention -- the proportion of images with multiple labels. Taking this characteristic into account, the results of our experiments provide evidence that there is no substantial degradation in effectiveness on ImageNetV2. Furthermore, we acknowledge that ImageNet pre-trained models exhibit some capability at capturing the multi-label nature of the dataset even though they were trained under the single-label assumption. Consequently, we propose a new evaluation approach to augment existing approaches that assess this capability. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the multi-label nature of the ImageNet dataset during benchmarking. Failing to do so could lead to incorrect conclusions regarding the effectiveness of DNNs and divert research efforts from addressing other substantial challenges related to the reliability and robustness of these models.",

In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery.

By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Annual maps of crop fields are key to understanding the nature of this transformation, but such maps are currently lacking and must be developed using advanced machine learning models trained on high resolution remote sensing imagery. To enable the development of such models, we delineated field boundaries in 33,746 Planet images captured between 2017 and 2023 across the continent using a custom labeling platform with built-in procedures for assessing and mitigating label error. We collected 42,403 labels, including 7,204 labels arising from tasks dedicated to assessing label quality (Class 1 labels), 32,167 from sites mapped once by a single labeller (Class 2) and 3,032 labels from sites where 3 or more labellers were tasked to map the same location (Class 4). Class 1 labels were used to calculate labeller-specific quality scores, while Class 1 and 4 sites mapped by at least 3 labellers were used to further evaluate label uncertainty using a Bayesian risk metric. Quality metrics showed that label quality was moderately high (0.75) for measures of total field extent, but low regarding the number of individual fields delineated (0.33), and the position of field edges (0.05). These values are expected when delineating small-scale fields in 3-5 m resolution imagery, which can be too coarse to reliably distinguish smaller fields, particularly in dense croplands, and therefore requires substantial labeller judgement. Nevertheless, previous work shows that such labels can train effective field mapping models. Furthermore, this large, probabilistic sample on its own provides valuable insight into regional agricultural characteristics, highlighting variations in the median field size and density. The imagery and vectorized labels along with quality information is available for download from two public repositories.",

VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals.

This paper introduces HTR-JAND (HTR-JAND: Handwritten Text Recognition with Joint Attention Network and Knowledge Distillation), an efficient HTR framework that combines advanced feature extraction with knowledge distillation. Our architecture incorporates three key components: (1) a CNN architecture integrating FullGatedConv2d layers with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for adaptive feature extraction, (2) a Combined Attention mechanism fusing Multi-Head Self-Attention with Proxima Attention for robust sequence modeling, and (3) a Knowledge Distillation framework enabling efficient model compression while preserving accuracy through curriculum-based training. The HTR-JAND framework implements a multi-stage training approach combining curriculum learning, synthetic data generation, and multi-task learning for cross-dataset knowledge transfer. We enhance recognition accuracy through context-aware T5 post-processing, particularly effective for historical documents. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate HTR-JAND's effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art Character Error Rates (CER) of 1.23\\%, 1.02\\%, and 2.02\\% on IAM, RIMES, and Bentham datasets respectively.

In this paper, we explore the idea that CV adopts discrete and terminological task definitions (\\eg, ``image segmentation''), which may be a key barrier to zero-shot task generalization. Our hypothesis is that without truly understanding previously-seen tasks--due to these terminological definitions--deep models struggle to generalize to novel tasks. To verify this, we introduce Explanatory Instructions, which provide an intuitive way to define CV task objectives through detailed linguistic transformations from input images to outputs. We create a large-scale dataset comprising 12 million ``image input $\\to$ explanatory instruction $\\to$ output'' triplets, and train an auto-regressive-based vision-language model (AR-based VLM) that takes both images and explanatory instructions as input. By learning to follow these instructions, the AR-based VLM achieves instruction-level zero-shot capabilities for previously-seen tasks and demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization for unseen CV tasks.

Therefore, 2D diffusion models trained on 2D slices are starting to be leveraged for 3D MRI reconstruction. However, as we show in this paper, existing methods pertain to a fixed voxel size, and performance degrades when the voxel size is varied, as it is often the case in clinical practice. In this paper, we propose and study several approaches for resolution-robust 3D MRI reconstruction with 2D diffusion priors. As a result of this investigation, we obtain a simple resolution-robust variational 3D reconstruction approach based on diffusion-guided regularization of randomly sampled 2D slices. This method provides competitive reconstruction quality compared to posterior sampling baselines. Towards resolving the sensitivity to resolution-shifts, we investigate state-of-the-art model-based approaches including Gaussian splatting, neural representations, and infinite-dimensional diffusion models, as well as a simple data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on several resolutions. Our experiments demonstrate that the model-based approaches fail to close the performance gap in 3D MRI. In contrast, the data-centric approach of training the diffusion model on various resolutions effectively provides a resolution-robust method without compromising accuracy.",

Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has emerged as a powerful diagnostic tool for visualizing the GI tract, but it requires time-consuming manual analysis by experienced gastroenterologists, which is prone to human error and inefficient given the increasing number of patients.To address this challenge, we propose ClassifyViStA, an AI-based framework designed for the automated detection and classification of bleeding and non-bleeding frames from WCE videos. The model consists of a standard classification path, augmented by two specialized branches: an implicit attention branch and a segmentation branch.The attention branch focuses on the bleeding regions, while the segmentation branch generates accurate segmentation masks, which are used for classification and interpretability. The model is built upon an ensemble of ResNet18 and VGG16 architectures to enhance classification performance. For the bleeding region detection, we implement a Soft Non-Maximum Suppression (Soft NMS) approach with YOLOv8, which improves the handling of overlapping bounding boxes, resulting in more accurate and nuanced detections.The system's interpretability is enhanced by using the segmentation masks to explain the classification results, offering insights into the decision-making process similar to the way a gastroenterologist identifies bleeding regions. Our approach not only automates the detection of GI bleeding but also provides an interpretable solution that can ease the burden on healthcare professionals and improve diagnostic efficiency.

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation.

Our key insight is to leverage the rich motion priors learned by state-of-the-art video generation models, which have been trained on vast amounts of natural human movements and interactions, and use differentiable rendering to reconstruct human-scene interactions. ZeroHSI can synthesize realistic human motions in both static scenes and environments with dynamic objects, without requiring any ground-truth motion data.

However, understanding the decision-making process of classifiers remains a significant challenge. We propose DiffEx, a novel method that leverages the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to explain classifier decisions. Unlike traditional GAN-based explainability models, which are limited to simple, single-concept analyses and typically require training a new model for each classifier, our approach can explain classifiers that focus on single concepts (such as faces or animals) as well as those that handle complex scenes involving multiple concepts. DiffEx employs vision-language models to create a hierarchical list of semantics, allowing users to identify not only the overarching semantic influences on classifiers (e.g., the 'beard' semantic in a facial classifier) but also their sub-types, such as 'goatee' or 'Balbo' beard. Our experiments demonstrate that DiffEx is able to cover a significantly broader spectrum of semantics compared to its GAN counterparts, providing a hierarchical tool that delivers a more detailed and fine-grained understanding of classifier decisions.",

These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin.

The approach integrates advanced signal processing, clustering, and visual analytics to identify subsurface anomalies. A unique adaptive thresholding method tailors frequency-based defect identification to the distinct material properties of each slab. The methodology generates frequency maps, binary masks, and k-means cluster maps to automatically classify defect and non-defect regions. Key visualizations, including 3D surface plots, cluster maps, and contour plots, are employed to analyze spatial frequency distributions and highlight structural anomalies. The study utilizes a labeled dataset constructed at the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) Advanced Sensing Technology Nondestructive Evaluation Laboratory. Evaluations involve ground-truth masking, comparing the generated defect maps with top-view binary masks derived from the information provided by the FHWA. The performance metrics, specifically F1-scores and AUC-ROC, achieve values of up to 0.95 and 0.83, respectively. The results demonstrate the robustness of the methodology, consistently identifying defect-prone areas with minimal false positives and few missed defects. Adaptive frequency thresholding ensures flexibility in addressing variations across slabs, providing a scalable framework for detecting structural anomalies. Additionally, the methodology is adaptable to other frequency-based signals due to its generalizable thresholding mechanism and holds potential for integrating multimodal sensor fusion.

In this paper, the effect of layer freezing in a pre-trained CNN is investigated for breast cancer detection by classifying mammogram images as benign or malignant. Different VGG19 scenarios have been examined based on the number of convolution layer blocks that have been frozen. There are a total of six scenarios in this study. The primary benefits of this research are twofold: it improves the model's ability to detect breast cancer cases and it reduces the training time of VGG19 by freezing certain layers.To evaluate the performance of these scenarios, 1693 microbiological images of benign and malignant breast cancers were utilized. According to the reported results, the best recognition rate was obtained from a frozen first block of VGG19 with a sensitivity of 95.64 %, while the training of the entire VGG19 yielded 94.48%.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.17991v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: One of the most elusive goals in myographic prosthesis control is the ability to reliably decode continuous positions simultaneously across multiple degrees-of-freedom. Goal: To demonstrate dexterous, natural, biomimetic finger and wrist control of the highly advanced robotic Modular Prosthetic Limb. Methods: We combine sequential temporal regression models and reinforcement learning using myographic signals to predict continuous simultaneous predictions of 7 finger and wrist degrees-of-freedom for 9 non-amputee human subjects in a minimally-constrained freeform training process. Results: We demonstrate highly dexterous 7 DoF position-based regression for prosthesis control from EMG signals, with significantly lower error rates than traditional approaches (p < 0.001) and nearly zero prediction response time delay (p < 0.001). Their performance can be continuously improved at any time using our freeform reinforcement process. Significance: We have demonstrated the most dexterous, biomimetic, and natural prosthesis control performance ever obtained from the surface EMG signal. Our reinforcement approach allowed us to abandon standard training protocols and simply allow the subject to move in any desired way while our models adapt. Conclusions: This work redefines the state-of-the-art in myographic decoding in terms of the reliability, responsiveness, and movement complexity available from prosthesis control systems. The present-day emergence and convergence of advanced algorithmic methods, experiment protocols, dexterous robotic prostheses, and sensor modalities represents a unique opportunity to finally realize our ultimate goal of achieving fully restorative natural upper-limb function for amputees.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.18160v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Given that the factors influencing image quality vary significantly with scene, content, and distortion type, particularly in the context of regional heterogeneity, we propose an adaptive multi-quality factor (AMqF) framework to represent image quality in a dictionary space, enabling the precise capture of quality features in non-uniformly distorted regions. By designing an adapter, the framework can flexibly decompose quality factors (such as brightness, structure, contrast, etc.) that best align with human visual perception and quantify them into discrete visual words. These visual words respond to the constructed dictionary basis vector, and by obtaining the corresponding coordinate vectors, we can measure visual similarity. Our method offers two key contributions. First, an adaptive mechanism that extracts and decomposes quality factors according to human visual perception principles enhances their representation ability through reconstruction constraints. Second, the construction of a comprehensive and discriminative dictionary space and basis vector allows quality factors to respond effectively to the dictionary basis vector and capture non-uniform distortion patterns in images, significantly improving the accuracy of visual similarity measurement. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in handling various types of distorted images.

Most existing methods rely on replay, focusing on enhancing memory retention through regularization or distillation. However, they often overlook the adaptability of the model, limiting the ability to learn generalizable and discriminative features incrementally from online training data. To address this, we introduce a plug-and-play module, S6MOD, which can be integrated into most existing methods and directly improve adaptability. Specifically, S6MOD introduces an extra branch after the backbone, where a mixture of discretization selectively adjusts parameters in a selective state space model, enriching selective scan patterns such that the model can adaptively select the most sensitive discretization method for current dynamics. We further design a class-conditional routing algorithm for dynamic, uncertainty-based adjustment and implement a contrastive discretization loss to optimize it. Extensive experiments combining our module with various models demonstrate that S6MOD significantly enhances model adaptability, leading to substantial performance gains and achieving the state-of-the-art results.",

Among the various fault types encountered in induction motors, bearing, rotor, and stator faults are the most prevalent. This paper introduces a Weighted Probability Ensemble Deep Learning (WPEDL) methodology, tailored for effectively diagnosing induction motor faults using high-dimensional data extracted from vibration and current features. The Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) is employed to extract features from both vibration and current signals. The performance of the WPEDL fault diagnosis method is compared against conventional deep learning models, demonstrating the superior efficacy of the proposed system. The multi-class fault diagnosis system based on WPEDL achieves high accuracies across different fault types: 99.05% for bearing (vibrational signal), 99.10%, and 99.50% for rotor (current and vibration signal), and 99.60%, and 99.52% for stator faults (current and vibration signal) respectively. To evaluate the robustness of our multi-class classification decisions, tests have been conducted on a combined dataset of 52,000 STFT images encompassing all three faults.

Yet, its underlying working principles remain somewhat elusive. What is its essence? Are there any connections between it and traditional machine learning algorithms? In this study, we inspect the process of computing similarity using classic metrics and vector space properties in manifold learning, clustering, and supervised learning. We identify the key characteristics of similarity computation and information propagation in these methods and demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism in deep learning adheres to the same principles but operates more flexibly and adaptively. We decompose the self-attention mechanism into a learnable pseudo-metric function and an information propagation process based on similarity computation. We prove that the self-attention mechanism converges to a drift-diffusion process through continuous modeling provided the pseudo-metric is a transformation of a metric and certain reasonable assumptions hold. This equation could be transformed into a heat equation under a new metric. In addition, we give a first-order analysis of attention mechanism with a general pseudo-metric function. This study aids in understanding the effects and principle of attention mechanism through physical intuition. Finally, we propose a modified attention mechanism called metric-attention by leveraging the concept of metric learning to facilitate the ability to learn desired metrics more effectively.

To eliminate this gap, we introduce a novel navigation task: Floor Plan Visual Navigation (FloNa), the first attempt to incorporate floor plan into embodied visual navigation.

To address these challenges, we propose FloDiff, a novel diffusion policy framework incorporating a localization module to facilitate alignment between the current observation and the floor plan.

Efficient compression of remote sensing imagery is a critical solution to alleviate these burdens on satellites. However, existing compression methods are often too computationally expensive for satellites. With the continued advancement of compressed sensing theory, single-pixel imaging emerges as a powerful tool that brings new possibilities for on-orbit image compression. However, it still suffers from prolonged imaging times and the inability to perform high-resolution imaging, hindering its practical application. This paper advances the study of compressed sensing in remote sensing image compression, proposing Block Modulated Imaging (BMI). By requiring only a single exposure, BMI significantly enhances imaging acquisition speeds. Additionally, BMI obviates the need for digital micromirror devices and surpasses limitations in image resolution. Furthermore, we propose a novel decoding network specifically designed to reconstruct images compressed under the BMI framework. Leveraging the gated 3D convolutions and promoting efficient information flow across stages through a Two-Way Cross-Attention module, our decoding network exhibits demonstrably superior reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple renowned remote sensing datasets unequivocally demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. To further validate its practical applicability, we developed and tested a prototype of the BMI-based camera, which has shown promising potential for on-orbit image compression.

Recently, transformers have been widely used in deep learning-based registration methods for their ability to capture long-range dependency via self-attention (SA). However, the high computation and memory loads of SA (growing quadratically with the spatial resolution) hinder transformers from processing subtle textural information in high-resolution image features, e.g., at the full and half image resolutions. This limits deformable registration as the high-resolution textural information is crucial for finding precise pixel-wise correspondence between subtle anatomical structures. Cross-covariance Attention (XCA), as a \"transposed\" version of SA that operates across feature channels, has complexity growing linearly with the spatial resolution, providing the feasibility of capturing long-range dependency among high-resolution image features. However, existing XCA-based transformers merely capture coarse global long-range dependency, which are unsuitable for deformable image registration relying primarily on fine-grained local correspondence. In this study, we propose to improve existing deep learning-based registration methods by embedding a new XCA mechanism. To this end, we design an XCA-based transformer block optimized for deformable medical image registration, named Multi-Axis XCA (MAXCA). Our MAXCA serves as a general network block that can be embedded into various registration network architectures. It can capture both global and local long-range dependency among high-resolution image features by applying regional and dilated XCA in parallel via a multi-axis design. Extensive experiments on two well-benchmarked inter-/intra-patient registration tasks with seven public medical datasets demonstrate that our MAXCA block enables state-of-the-art registration performance.",

However, existing synthesis methods, which are typically unconditional -- generating images from random variables -- or conditioned only by tumor shapes, lack controllability over specific tumor characteristics such as texture, heterogeneity, boundaries, and pathology type. As a result, the generated tumors may be overly similar or duplicates of existing training data, failing to effectively address AI's weaknesses. We propose a new text-driven tumor synthesis approach, termed TextoMorph, that provides textual control over tumor characteristics. This is particularly beneficial for examples that confuse the AI the most, such as early tumor detection (increasing Sensitivity by +8.5%), tumor segmentation for precise radiotherapy (increasing DSC by +6.3%), and classification between benign and malignant tumors (improving Sensitivity by +8.2%). By incorporating text mined from radiology reports into the synthesis process, we increase the variability and controllability of the synthetic tumors to target AI's failure cases more precisely. Moreover, TextoMorph uses contrastive learning across different texts and CT scans, significantly reducing dependence on scarce image-report pairs (only 141 pairs used in this study) by leveraging a large corpus of 34,035 radiology reports.

Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions.

For example, CLIP can robustly identify regular (horizontal) and irregular (rotated, curved, blurred, or occluded) text in images. With such merits, we transform CLIP into a scene text reader and introduce CLIP4STR, a simple yet effective STR method built upon image and text encoders of CLIP. It has two encoder-decoder branches: a visual branch and a cross-modal branch. The visual branch provides an initial prediction based on the visual feature, and the cross-modal branch refines this prediction by addressing the discrepancy between the visual feature and text semantics. To fully leverage the capabilities of both branches, we design a dual predict-and-refine decoding scheme for inference. We scale CLIP4STR in terms of the model size, pre-training data, and training data, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 13 STR benchmarks.

However, they use pivot embedding in a global manner (i.e., aligning an image embedding with sentence-level text embedding), which does not fully utilize the semantic cues of given text description. In this work, we advocate for the use of local alignment between image regions and corresponding textual descriptions to get domain-invariant features. To this end, we first represent image and text inputs as graphs. We then cluster nodes within these graphs and match the graph-based image node features to the nodes of textual graphs. This matching process is conducted both globally and locally, tightly aligning visual and textual semantic sub-structures.

Typical approaches attempt to exploit anatomy and topology priors to directly expand sparse annotations into pseudo-labels. However, due to a lack of attention to the ambiguous edges in medical images and insufficient exploration of sparse supervision, existing approaches tend to generate erroneous and overconfident pseudo proposals in noisy regions, leading to cumulative model error and performance degradation. In this work, we propose a novel WSS approach, named ProCNS, encompassing two synergistic modules devised with the principles of progressive prototype calibration and noise suppression. Specifically, we design a Prototype-based Regional Spatial Affinity (PRSA) loss to maximize the pair-wise affinities between spatial and semantic elements, providing our model of interest with more reliable guidance. The affinities are derived from the input images and the prototype-refined predictions. Meanwhile, we propose an Adaptive Noise Perception and Masking (ANPM) module to obtain more enriched and representative prototype representations, which adaptively identifies and masks noisy regions within the pseudo proposals, reducing potential erroneous interference during prototype computation. Furthermore, we generate specialized soft pseudo-labels for the noisy regions identified by ANPM, providing supplementary supervision.

    "summary": "arXiv:2402.02431v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recognizing interactive actions, including hand-to-hand interaction and human-to-human interaction, has attracted increasing attention for various applications in the field of video analysis and human-robot interaction. Considering the success of graph convolution in modeling topology-aware features from skeleton data, recent methods commonly operate graph convolution on separate entities and use late fusion for interactive action recognition, which can barely model the mutual semantic relationships between pairwise entities. To this end, we propose a mutual excitation graph convolutional network (me-GCN) by stacking mutual excitation graph convolution (me-GC) layers. Specifically, me-GC uses a mutual topology excitation module to firstly extract adjacency matrices from individual entities and then adaptively model the mutual constraints between them. Moreover, me-GC extends the above idea and further uses a mutual feature excitation module to extract and merge deep features from pairwise entities. Compared with graph convolution, our proposed me-GC gradually learns mutual information in each layer and each stage of graph convolution operations. Extensive experiments on a challenging hand-to-hand interaction dataset, i.e., the Assembely101 dataset, and two large-scale human-to-human interaction datasets, i.e., NTU60-Interaction and NTU120-Interaction consistently verify the superiority of our proposed method, which outperforms the state-of-the-art GCN-based and Transformer-based methods.",

Pedestrian images in real-world scenarios, however, are often partially obscured by obstacles, presenting a significant challenge to existing CC-ReID systems. In this paper, we introduce a more challenging task termed Occluded Cloth-Changing Person Re-Identification (OC4-ReID), which simultaneously addresses two challenges of clothing changes and occlusion. Concretely, we construct two new datasets, Occ-LTCC and Occ-PRCC, based on original CC-ReID datasets to include random occlusions of key pedestrians components (e.g., head, torso). Moreover, a novel benchmark is proposed for OC4-ReID incorporating a Train-Test Micro Granularity Screening (T2MGS) module to mitigate the influence of occlusion and proposing a Part-Robust Triplet (PRT) loss for partial features learning. Comprehensive experiments on the proposed datasets, as well as on two CC-ReID benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of proposed method against other state-of-the-art methods.

    "summary": "arXiv:2404.09292v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Remote sensing semantic segmentation (RSS) is an essential technology in earth observation missions. Due to concerns over geographic information security, data privacy, storage bottleneck and industry competition, high-quality annotated remote sensing images are often isolated and distributed across institutions. The issue of remote sensing data islands poses challenges for fully utilizing isolated datasets to train a global model. Federated learning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed collaborative learning technology, offers a potential solution to leverage isolated remote sensing data. Typically, remote sensing images from different institutions exhibit significant geographic heterogeneity, characterized by coupled class-distribution heterogeneity and object-appearance heterogeneity. However, existing FL methods lack consideration of them, leading to a decline in the performance of the global model when FL is directly applied to RSS. We propose a novel Geographic heterogeneity-aware Federated learning (GeoFed) framework to bridge data islands in RSS. Our framework consists of three modules, including the Global Insight Enhancement (GIE) module, the Essential Feature Mining (EFM) module and the Local-Global Balance (LoGo) module. Through the GIE module, class distribution heterogeneity is alleviated by introducing a prior global class distribution vector. We design an EFM module to alleviate object appearance heterogeneity by constructing essential features. Furthermore, the LoGo module enables the model to possess both global generalization capability and local adaptation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (i.e., FedFBP, FedCASID, FedInria) demonstrate that our GeoFed framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.",

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we learn traffic evolution from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing spatial relations from both origin and destination perspectives.

A recent attempt relaxed the assumption by introducing limited human annotation, referred to as Human-In-the-Loop Test-Time Adaptation (HILTTA) in this study. The focus of existing HILTTA studies lies in selecting the most informative samples to label, a.k.a. active learning. In this work, we are motivated by a pitfall of TTA, i.e. sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and propose to approach HILTTA by synergizing active learning and model selection. Specifically, we first select samples for human annotation (active learning) and then use the labeled data to select optimal hyper-parameters (model selection). To prevent the model selection process from overfitting to local distributions, multiple regularization techniques are employed to complement the validation objective. A sample selection strategy is further tailored by considering the balance between active learning and model selection purposes. We demonstrate on 5 TTA datasets that the proposed HILTTA approach is compatible with off-the-shelf TTA methods and such combinations substantially outperform the state-of-the-art HILTTA methods.

Incorporating specific corruptions into the data augmentation pipeline can improve robustness to those corruptions but may harm performance on clean images and other types of distortion. In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach that improves the robustness of DNNs to a wide range of corruptions without compromising accuracy on clean images. We first demonstrate that input perturbations can be mimicked by multiplicative perturbations in the weight space. Leveraging this, we propose Data Augmentation via Multiplicative Perturbation (DAMP), a training method that optimizes DNNs under random multiplicative weight perturbations. We also examine the recently proposed Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (ASAM) and show that it optimizes DNNs under adversarial multiplicative weight perturbations. Experiments on image classification datasets (CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet) and neural network architectures (ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-B/16) show that DAMP enhances model generalization performance in the presence of corruptions across different settings.

However, one significant drawback of ViTs is their resource-intensive nature, leading to increased memory footprint, computation complexity, and power consumption. To democratize this high-performance technology and make it more environmentally friendly, it is essential to compress ViT models, reducing their resource requirements while maintaining high performance. In this paper, we introduce a new block-structured pruning to address the resource-intensive issue for ViTs, offering a balanced trade-off between accuracy and hardware acceleration. Unlike unstructured pruning or channel-wise structured pruning, block pruning leverages the block-wise structure of linear layers, resulting in more efficient matrix multiplications. To optimize this pruning scheme, our paper proposes a novel hardware-aware learning objective that simultaneously maximizes speedup and minimizes power consumption during inference, tailored to the block sparsity structure. This objective eliminates the need for empirical look-up tables and focuses solely on reducing parametrized layer connections. Moreover, our paper provides a lightweight algorithm to achieve post-training pruning for ViTs, utilizing second-order Taylor approximation and empirical optimization to solve the proposed hardware-aware objective. Extensive experiments on ImageNet are conducted across various ViT architectures, including DeiT-B and DeiT-S, demonstrating competitive performance with other pruning methods and achieving a remarkable balance between accuracy preservation and power savings. Especially, we achieve up to 3.93x and 1.79x speedups on dedicated hardware and GPUs respectively for DeiT-B, and also observe an inference power reduction by 1.4x on real-world GPUs.",

On the other hand, some training-based methods launch an attack through a single forward inference, whereas failing to directly learn high-level mappings from prediction vectors to images. Addressing these limitations, we propose a novel Prediction-to-Image (P2I) method for black-box MI attack. Specifically, we introduce the Prediction Alignment Encoder to map the target model's output prediction into the latent code of StyleGAN. In this way, prediction vector space can be well aligned with the more disentangled latent space, thus establishing a connection between prediction vectors and the semantic facial features. During the attack phase, we further design the Aligned Ensemble Attack scheme to integrate complementary facial attributes of target identity for better reconstruction.

In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.",

However, modern approaches often produce temporal artifacts, e.g. in form of jittery motion and struggle to achieve smooth and physically plausible motions. Explicitly integrating physics, in form of internal forces and exterior torques, helps alleviating these artifacts. Current state-of-the-art approaches make use of an automatic PD controller to predict torques and reaction forces in order to re-simulate the input kinematics, i.e. the joint angles of a predefined skeleton. However, due to imperfect physical models, these methods often require simplifying assumptions and extensive preprocessing of the input kinematics to achieve good performance. To this end, we propose a novel method to selectively incorporate the physics models with the kinematics observations in an online setting, inspired by a neural Kalman-filtering approach. We develop a control loop as a meta-PD controller to predict internal joint torques and external reaction forces, followed by a physics-based motion simulation. A recurrent neural network is introduced to realize a Kalman filter that attentively balances the kinematics input and simulated motion, resulting in an optimal-state dynamics prediction. We show that this filtering step is crucial to provide an online supervision that helps balancing the shortcoming of the respective input motions, thus being important for not only capturing accurate global motion trajectories but also producing physically plausible human poses. The proposed approach excels in the physics-based human pose estimation task and demonstrates the physical plausibility of the predictive dynamics, compared to state of the art.

In this paper, we propose a new pretraining paradigm for LMMs to enhance the visual comprehension capabilities of LLMs by introducing a novel cross-modal comprehension stage. Specifically, we design a dynamically learnable prompt token pool and employ the Hungarian algorithm to replace part of the original visual tokens with the most relevant prompt tokens. Then, we conceptualize visual tokens as analogous to a \"foreign language\" for the LLMs and propose a mixed attention mechanism with bidirectional visual attention and unidirectional textual attention to comprehensively enhance the understanding of visual tokens. Meanwhile, we integrate a detailed caption generation task, leveraging rich descriptions to further facilitate LLMs in understanding visual semantic information. After pretraining on 1.5 million publicly accessible data, we present a new foundation model called Croc.

However, its ultimate performance is constrained by how accurate the pretrained model captures the true data scores at different stages of the diffusion process. In this paper, we introduce SiDA (SiD with Adversarial Loss), which not only enhances generation quality but also improves distillation efficiency by incorporating real images and adversarial loss. SiDA utilizes the encoder from the generator's score network as a discriminator, allowing it to distinguish between real images and those generated by SiD. The adversarial loss is batch-normalized within each GPU and then combined with the original SiD loss. This integration effectively incorporates the average \"fakeness\" per GPU batch into the pixel-based SiD loss, enabling SiDA to distill a single-step generator. SiDA converges significantly faster than its predecessor when distilled from scratch, and swiftly improves upon the original model's performance during fine-tuning from a pre-distilled SiD generator. This one-step adversarial distillation method establishes new benchmarks in generation performance when distilling EDM diffusion models, achieving FID scores of 1.110 on ImageNet 64x64.

    "summary": "arXiv:2410.15446v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Models based on human-understandable concepts have received extensive attention to improve model interpretability for trustworthy artificial intelligence in the field of medical image analysis. These methods can provide convincing explanations for model decisions but heavily rely on the detailed annotation of pre-defined concepts. Consequently, they may not be effective in cases where concepts or annotations are incomplete or low-quality. Although some methods automatically discover effective and new visual concepts rather than using pre-defined concepts or could find some human-understandable concepts via large Language models, they are prone to veering away from medical diagnostic evidence and are challenging to understand. In this paper, we propose a concept complement bottleneck model for interpretable medical image diagnosis with the aim of complementing the existing concept set and finding new concepts bridging the gap between explainable models. Specifically, we propose to use concept adapters for specific concepts to mine the concept differences and score concepts in their own attention channels to support almost fairly concept learning. Then, we devise a concept complement strategy to learn new concepts while jointly using known concepts to improve model performance. Comprehensive experiments on medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in concept detection and disease diagnosis tasks while providing diverse explanations to ensure model interpretability effectively.",

We frame human preference alignment as online reinforcement learning using human feedback (RLHF), where the goal is to maximize the reward function while regularizing the generator distribution to remain close to a reference diffusion process. Unlike traditional RLHF approaches, which rely on the KL divergence for regularization, we introduce a novel score-based divergence regularization, which leads to significantly better performances. Although the direct calculation of this preference alignment objective remains intractable, we demonstrate that we can efficiently compute its gradient by deriving an equivalent yet tractable loss function. Remarkably, we used Diff-Instruct* to train a Stable Diffusion-XL-based 1-step model, the 2.6B DI*-SDXL-1step text-to-image model, which can generate images of a resolution of 1024x1024 with only 1 generation step. DI*-SDXL-1step model uses only 1.88% inference time and 29.30% GPU memory cost to outperform 12B FLUX-dev-50step significantly in PickScore, ImageReward, and CLIPScore on Parti prompt benchmark and HPSv2.1 on Human Preference Score benchmark, establishing a new state-of-the-art benchmark of human-preferred 1-step text-to-image generative models.

Unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration methods have recently emerged to circumvent the need for costly pose annotations. However, they fail to establish reliable optimization objectives for unsupervised training, either relying on overly strong geometric assumptions, or suffering from poor-quality pseudo-labels due to inadequate integration of low-level geometric and high-level contextual information. We have observed that in the feature space, latent new inlier correspondences tend to cluster around respective positive anchors that summarize features of existing inliers. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel unsupervised registration method termed INTEGER to incorporate high-level contextual information for reliable pseudo-label mining. Specifically, we propose the Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module to dynamically adapt the teacher for each mini-batch of data during training and discover reliable pseudo-labels by considering both high-level feature representations and low-level geometric cues. Furthermore, we propose Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning to facilitate contrastive learning with anchors for a robust feature space. Lastly, we introduce a Mixed-Density Student to learn density-invariant features, addressing challenges related to density variation and low overlap in the outdoor scenario. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our INTEGER achieves competitive performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability.",

Tracking the evolution of nevi and detecting new lesions across the body is essential for the early detection of melanoma. Despite prior work on longitudinal tracking of skin lesions in 3D total body photography, there are still several challenges, including 1) low accuracy for finding correct lesion pairs across scans, 2) sensitivity to noisy lesion detection, and 3) lack of large-scale datasets with numerous annotated lesion pairs. We propose a framework that takes in a pair of 3D textured meshes, matches lesions in the context of total body photography, and identifies unmatchable lesions. We start by computing correspondence maps bringing the source and target meshes to a template mesh. Using these maps to define source/target signals over the template domain, we construct a flow field aligning the mapped signals. The initial correspondence maps are then refined by advecting forward/backward along the vector field. Finally, lesion assignment is performed using the refined correspondence maps. We propose the first large-scale dataset for skin lesion tracking with 25K lesion pairs across 198 subjects. The proposed method achieves a success rate of 89.9% (at 10 mm criterion) for all pairs of annotated lesions and a matching accuracy of 98.2% for subjects with more than 200 lesions.",

Notably, the framework does not require any fine-tuning of the generative models and can be extended to incorporate more modalities.

In particular, we first present the Distortion-aware Learnable Query Mechanism (DLQM), which defines the latent spatial relationships for different distortion degrees as a series of learnable queries. Each query can be learned to obtain position-dependent rectification control conditions, providing control over the rectification process. Then, we propose two kinds of controllable modulating blocks to enable the control conditions to guide the modulation of the distortion features better. These core components cooperate with each other to effectively boost the generalization ability of the model at varying degrees of distortion.

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.",

It first samples the scene distribution by generating 2D fluoroscopy images with wires positioned according to a specified input mask, and then samples the motion distribution by progressively generating subsequent frames, ensuring frame-to-frame coherence through a frame-consistency strategy. A segmentation-guided mechanism further refines the process by adjusting wire contrast, ensuring a diverse range of visibility in the synthesized image. Evaluation on a fluoroscopy dataset confirms the superior quality of the generated videos and shows significant improvements in guidewire segmentation.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.16662v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Adversarial attacks on image classification systems have always been an important problem in the field of machine learning, and generative adversarial networks (GANs), as popular models in the field of image generation, have been widely used in various novel scenarios due to their powerful generative capabilities. However, with the popularity of generative adversarial networks, the misuse of fake image technology has raised a series of security problems, such as malicious tampering with other people's photos and videos, and invasion of personal privacy. Inspired by the generative adversarial networks, this work proposes a novel adversarial attack method, aiming to gain insight into the weaknesses of the image classification system and improve its anti-attack ability. Specifically, the generative adversarial networks are used to generate adversarial samples with small perturbations but enough to affect the decision-making of the classifier, and the adversarial samples are generated through the adversarial learning of the training generator and the classifier. From extensive experiment analysis, we evaluate the effectiveness of the method on a classical image classification dataset, and the results show that our model successfully deceives a variety of advanced classifiers while maintaining the naturalness of adversarial samples.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.16839v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications (e.g., rare wildlife observation) is limited by the small number of available images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective way to address this limitation. However, since the automatic generation process is uncontrollable, the generated images are usually limited in diversity, and some of them are undesired. In this paper, we propose a human-guided image generation method for more controllable dataset expansion. We develop a multi-modal projection method with theoretical guarantees to facilitate the exploration of both the original and generated images. Based on the exploration, users refine the prompts and re-generate images for better performance. Since directly refining the prompts is challenging for novice users, we develop a sample-level prompt refinement method to make it easier. With this method, users only need to provide sample-level feedback (e.g., which samples are undesired) to obtain better prompts. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through the quantitative evaluation of the multi-modal projection method, improved model performance in the case study for both classification and object detection tasks, and positive feedback from the experts.",

However, indiscriminately applying prompts to every layer without considering their inherent correlations, can cause significant disturbances, leading to suboptimal transferability. Additionally, VPT disrupts the original self-attention structure, affecting the aggregation of visual features, and lacks a mechanism for explicitly mining discriminative visual features, which are crucial for classification. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Hierarchical Prompt (SHIP) fine-tuning strategy. We adaptively construct semantic hierarchies and use semantic-independent and semantic-shared prompts to learn hierarchical representations. We also integrate attribute prompts and a prompt matching loss to enhance feature discrimination and employ decoupled attention for robustness and reduced inference costs. SHIP significantly improves performance, achieving a 4.9% gain in accuracy over VPT with a ViT-B/16 backbone on VTAB-1k tasks. Our code is available at https://github.com/haoweiz23/SHIP.",

Existing facial privacy protection schemes usually adopt adversarial examples to disrupt face verification of FR models. However, these schemes often suffer from weak transferability against black-box FR models and permanently damage the identifiable information that cannot fulfill the requirements of authorized operations such as forensics and authentication. To address these limitations, we propose ErasableMask, a robust and erasable privacy protection scheme against black-box FR models. Specifically, via rethinking the inherent relationship between surrogate FR models, ErasableMask introduces a novel meta-auxiliary attack, which boosts black-box transferability by learning more general features in a stable and balancing optimization strategy. It also offers a perturbation erasion mechanism that supports the erasion of semantic perturbations in protected face without degrading image quality. To further improve performance, ErasableMask employs a curriculum learning strategy to mitigate optimization conflicts between adversarial attack and perturbation erasion. Extensive experiments on the CelebA-HQ and FFHQ datasets demonstrate that ErasableMask achieves the state-of-the-art performance in transferability, achieving over 72% confidence on average in commercial FR systems. Moreover, ErasableMask also exhibits outstanding perturbation erasion performance, achieving over 90% erasion success rate.",

We ask an ambitious question: can a pre-trained AR model be adapted to generate outputs in just one or two steps? If successful, this would significantly advance the development and deployment of AR models. We notice that existing works that try to speed up AR generation by generating multiple tokens at once fundamentally cannot capture the output distribution due to the conditional dependencies between tokens, limiting their effectiveness for few-step generation. To address this, we propose Distilled Decoding (DD), which uses flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of the pre-trained AR model. We then train a network to distill this mapping, enabling few-step generation. DD doesn't need the training data of the original AR model, making it more practical. We evaluate DD on state-of-the-art image AR models and present promising results on ImageNet-256. For VAR, which requires 10-step generation, DD enables one-step generation (6.3$\\times$ speed-up), with an acceptable increase in FID from 4.19 to 9.96. For LlamaGen, DD reduces generation from 256 steps to 1, achieving an 217.8$\\times$ speed-up with a comparable FID increase from 4.11 to 11.35. In both cases, baseline methods completely fail with FID>100. DD also excels on text-to-image generation, reducing the generation from 256 steps to 2 for LlamaGen with minimal FID increase from 25.70 to 28.95. As the first work to demonstrate the possibility of one-step generation for image AR models, DD challenges the prevailing notion that AR models are inherently slow, and opens up new opportunities for efficient AR generation.

Moreover, most compression techniques for generative models have been developed primarily for GANs, tailored to specific architectures like StyleGAN, and research into compressing Diffusion models has just begun. Even more, these methods are often applicable only to GANs or Diffusion models, highlighting the need for approaches that work across both model types. In this paper, we introduce Singular Value Scaling (SVS), a versatile technique for refining pruned weights, applicable to both model types. Our analysis reveals that pruned weights often exhibit dominant singular vectors, hindering fine-tuning efficiency and leading to suboptimal performance compared to random initialization. Our method enhances weight initialization by minimizing the disparities between singular values of pruned weights, thereby improving the fine-tuning process. This approach not only guides the compressed model toward superior solutions but also significantly speeds up fine-tuning.

However, relying solely on the RGB color space often fall short, frequently leaving residual haze. This arises from two main issues: the difficulty in obtaining clear textural features from hazy RGB images and the complexity of acquiring real haze/clean image pairs outside controlled environments like smoke-filled scenes. To address these issues, we first propose a novel Structure Guided Dehazing Network (SGDN) that leverages the superior structural properties of YCbCr features over RGB. It comprises two key modules: Bi-Color Guidance Bridge (BGB) and Color Enhancement Module (CEM). BGB integrates a phase integration module and an interactive attention module, utilizing the rich texture features of the YCbCr space to guide the RGB space, thereby recovering clearer features in both frequency and spatial domains. To maintain tonal consistency, CEM further enhances the color perception of RGB features by aggregating YCbCr channel information. Furthermore, for effective supervised learning, we introduce a Real-World Well-Aligned Haze (RW$^2$AH) dataset, which includes a diverse range of scenes from various geographical regions and climate conditions.

However, the techniques still suffer from issues such as inappropriate background and inconsistent product in generated product images, and existing approaches for evaluating the quality of generated product images are mostly inconsistent with human feedback causing the evaluation for this task to depend on manual annotation. To relieve the issues above, this paper proposes Human Feedback and Product Consistency (HFPC), which can automatically assess the generated product images based on two modules. Firstly, to solve inappropriate backgrounds, human feedback on 44,000 automated inpainting product images is collected to train a reward model based on multi-modal features extracted from BLIP and comparative learning. Secondly, to filter generated product images containing inconsistent products, a fine-tuned segmentation model is employed to segment the product of the original and generated product images and then compare the differences between the above two. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that HFPC can effectively evaluate the quality of generated product images and significantly reduce the expense of manual annotation. Moreover, HFPC achieves state-of-the-art(96.4% in precision) in comparison to other open-source visual-quality-assessment models.

Most existing works primarily focus on rendering 2D feature maps from novel viewpoints, which leads to an imprecise 3D language field with outlier languages, ultimately failing to align objects in 3D space. By utilizing masked images for feature extraction, these approaches also lack essential contextual information, leading to inaccurate feature representation. To this end, we propose a Language-Embedded Surface Field (LangSurf), which accurately aligns the 3D language fields with the surface of objects, facilitating precise 2D and 3D segmentation with text query, widely expanding the downstream tasks such as removal and editing. The core of LangSurf is a joint training strategy that flattens the language Gaussian on the object surfaces using geometry supervision and contrastive losses to assign accurate language features to the Gaussians of objects. In addition, we also introduce the Hierarchical-Context Awareness Module to extract features at the image level for contextual information then perform hierarchical mask pooling using masks segmented by SAM to obtain fine-grained language features in different hierarchies. Extensive experiments on open-vocabulary 2D and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that LangSurf outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method LangSplat by a large margin.

By identifying and prioritizing regions with high geometric complexity during training, our method significantly improves the preservation of fine-grained shape features. Such sampling strategy and the dual attention mechanism enable the VAE to focus on crucial geometric details that are typically missed by uniform sampling approaches. To systematically evaluate VAE reconstruction quality, we additionally propose Dora-bench, a benchmark that quantifies shape complexity through the density of sharp edges, introducing a new metric focused on reconstruction accuracy at these salient geometric features. Extensive experiments on the Dora-bench demonstrate that Dora-VAE achieves comparable reconstruction quality to the state-of-the-art dense XCube-VAE while requiring a latent space at least 8$\\times$ smaller (1,280 vs. > 10,000 codes).

Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the \"Foundation Models.\" In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings.

Natural data such as images are believed to be composed of features organized in a hierarchical and combinatorial manner, which neural networks capture during learning. Recent advancements show that diffusion models can generate high-quality images, hinting at their ability to capture this underlying compositional structure. We study this phenomenon in a hierarchical generative model of data. We find that the backward diffusion process acting after a time $t$ is governed by a phase transition at some threshold time, where the probability of reconstructing high-level features, like the class of an image, suddenly drops. Instead, the reconstruction of low-level features, such as specific details of an image, evolves smoothly across the whole diffusion process. This result implies that at times beyond the transition, the class has changed, but the generated sample may still be composed of low-level elements of the initial image. We validate these theoretical insights through numerical experiments on class-unconditional ImageNet diffusion models. Our analysis characterizes the relationship between time and scale in diffusion models and puts forward generative models as powerful tools to model combinatorial data properties.",

Unfortunately, the majority of past XAI work is based on informal approaches, that offer no guarantees of rigor. Unsurprisingly, there exists comprehensive experimental and theoretical evidence confirming that informal methods of XAI can provide human-decision makers with erroneous information. Logic-based XAI represents a rigorous approach to explainability; it is model-based and offers the strongest guarantees of rigor of computed explanations. However, a well-known drawback of logic-based XAI is the complexity of logic reasoning, especially for highly complex ML models. Recent work proposed distance-restricted explanations, i.e. explanations that are rigorous provided the distance to a given input is small enough. Distance-restricted explainability is tightly related with adversarial robustness, and it has been shown to scale for moderately complex ML models, but the number of inputs still represents a key limiting factor. This paper investigates novel algorithms for scaling up the performance of logic-based explainers when computing and enumerating ML model explanations with a large number of inputs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2407.07755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Neural surfaces (e.g., neural map encoding, deep implicits and neural radiance fields) have recently gained popularity because of their generic structure (e.g., multi-layer perceptron) and easy integration with modern learning-based setups. Traditionally, we have a rich toolbox of geometry processing algorithms designed for polygonal meshes to analyze and operate on surface geometry. In the absence of an analogous toolbox, neural representations are typically discretized and converted into a mesh, before applying any geometry processing algorithm. This is unsatisfactory and, as we demonstrate, unnecessary. In this work, we propose a spherical neural surface representation for genus-0 surfaces and demonstrate how to compute core geometric operators directly on this representation. Namely, we estimate surface normals and first and second fundamental forms of the surface, as well as compute surface gradient, surface divergence and Laplace-Beltrami operator on scalar/vector fields defined on the surface. Our representation is fully seamless, overcoming a key limitation of similar explicit representations such as Neural Surface Maps [Morreale et al. 2021]. These operators, in turn, enable geometry processing directly on the neural representations without any unnecessary meshing. We demonstrate illustrative applications in (neural) spectral analysis, heat flow and mean curvature flow, and evaluate robustness to isometric shape variations. We propose theoretical formulations and validate their numerical estimates, against analytical estimates, mesh-based baselines, and neural alternatives, where available. By systematically linking neural surface representations with classical geometry processing algorithms, we believe that this work can become a key ingredient in enabling neural geometry processing. Code will be released upon acceptance, accessible from the project webpage.",

This work introduces CLAT, an innovative approach that mitigates adversarial overfitting by introducing parameter efficiency into the adversarial training process, improving both clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. Instead of tuning the entire model, CLAT identifies and fine-tunes robustness-critical layers - those predominantly learning non-robust features - while freezing the remaining model to enhance robustness. It employs dynamic critical layer selection to adapt to changes in layer criticality throughout the fine-tuning process. Empirically, CLAT can be applied on top of existing adversarial training methods, significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 95%, and achieves more than a 2% improvement in adversarial robustness compared to baseline methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2408.14947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Detecting unexpected objects (anomalies) in real time has great potential for monitoring, managing, and protecting the environment. Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with four existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX was evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX edge computing module (6-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 20W power draw), achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. ERX was 9 times faster than the next-best algorithm on the dataset with the highest number of bands (108 band), with an average speed of 561 lines per second on the Jetson. It achieved a 29.3% AUC improvement over the next-best algorithm on the most challenging dataset, while showing greater adaptability through consistently high AUC scores regardless of the camera's starting location. ERX performed robustly across all datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.941 on a drone-collected hyperspectral line scan dataset without geometric corrections (a 16.9% improvement over existing algorithms). This work enables future research on the detection of anomalous objects in real time, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

While extant research has endeavored to extend the application of 3DGS from static to dynamic scenes, such efforts have been consistently impeded by excessive model sizes, constraints on video duration, and content deviation. These limitations significantly compromise the streamability of dynamic 3D Gaussian models, thereby restricting their utility in downstream applications, including volumetric video, autonomous vehicle, and immersive technologies such as virtual, augmented, and mixed reality.\n  This paper introduces SwinGS, a novel framework for training, delivering, and rendering volumetric video in a real-time streaming fashion. To address the aforementioned challenges and enhance streamability, SwinGS integrates spacetime Gaussian with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to adapt the model to fit various 3D scenes across frames, in the meantime employing a sliding window captures Gaussian snapshots for each frame in an accumulative way. We implement a prototype of SwinGS and demonstrate its streamability across various datasets and scenes. Additionally, we develop an interactive WebGL viewer enabling real-time volumetric video playback on most devices with modern browsers, including smartphones and tablets. Experimental results show that SwinGS reduces transmission costs by 83.6% compared to previous work with ignorable compromise in PSNR. Moreover, SwinGS easily scales to long video sequences without compromising quality.",

Through analytical analysis of a simple case and experimental results with two recent learned video codecs, we show how averaged RD curves can mislead comparative evaluation of different codecs, particularly when videos in a dataset have varying characteristics and operating ranges. We illustrate how a single video with distinct RD characteristics from the rest of the test set can disproportionately influence the average RD curve, potentially overshadowing a codec's superior performance across most individual sequences. Using two recent learned video codecs on the UVG dataset as a case study, we demonstrate computing performance metrics, such as the BD rate, from the average RD curve suggests conclusions that contradict those reached from calculating the average of per-sequence metrics. Hence, we argue that the learned video compression community should also report per-sequence RD curves and performance metrics for a test set should be computed from the average of per-sequence metrics, similar to the established practice in traditional video coding, to ensure fair and accurate codec comparisons.",

In this work, an efficient and non-IID robust federated continual learning framework, called Federated Prototype-Augmented Prompt Learning (FPPL), is proposed. The FPPL can collaboratively learn lightweight prompts augmented by prototypes without rehearsal. On the client side, a fusion function is employed to fully leverage the knowledge contained in task-specific prompts for alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, global prototypes aggregated from the server are used to obtain unified representation through contrastive learning, mitigating the impact of non-IID-derived data heterogeneity. On the server side, locally uploaded prototypes are utilized to perform debiasing on the classifier, further alleviating the performance degradation caused by both non-IID and catastrophic forgetting.

By injecting action components into the VLMs, Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) can be naturally formed and also show promising performance. Existing work has demonstrated the effectiveness and generalization of VLAs in multiple scenarios and tasks. Nevertheless, the transfer from VLMs to VLAs is not trivial since existing VLAs differ in their backbones, action-prediction formulations, data distributions, and training recipes. This leads to a missing piece for a systematic understanding of the design choices of VLAs. In this work, we disclose the key factors that significantly influence the performance of VLA and focus on answering three essential design choices: which backbone to select, how to formulate the VLA architectures, and when to add cross-embodiment data. The obtained results convince us firmly to explain why we need VLA and develop a new family of VLAs, RoboVLMs, which require very few manual designs and achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in three simulation tasks and real-world experiments. Through our extensive experiments, which include over 8 VLM backbones, 4 policy architectures, and over 600 distinct designed experiments, we provide a detailed guidebook for the future design of VLAs. In addition to the study, the highly flexible RoboVLMs framework, which supports easy integrations of new VLMs and free combinations of various design choices, is made public to facilitate future research.

Bone suppression techniques have been developed to improve diagnostic accuracy. Dual-energy subtraction (DES) imaging, a common method for bone suppression, is costly and exposes patients to higher radiation levels. Deep learning-based image generation methods have been proposed as alternatives, however, they often fail to produce high-quality and high-resolution images, resulting in the loss of critical lesion information and texture details. To address these issues, in this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework for bone suppression in high-resolution CXR images, termed BS-LDM. This framework employs a conditional latent diffusion model to generate high-resolution soft tissue images with fine detail and critical lung pathology by performing bone suppression in the latent space. We implement offset noise during the noise addition phase of the training process to better render low-frequency information in soft tissue images. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic clipping strategy during the sampling process to refine pixel intensity in the generated soft tissue images. We compiled a substantial and high-quality bone suppression dataset, SZCH-X-Rays, including high-resolution paired CXR and DES soft tissue images from 818 patients, collected from our partner hospitals. Moreover, we pre-processed 241 pairs of CXR and DES soft tissue images from the JSRT dataset, the largest publicly available dataset. Comprehensive experimental and clinical evaluations demonstrate that BS-LDM exhibits superior bone suppression capabilities, highlighting its significant clinical potential.",

For example, given an instruction \"Please get the right red towel hanging on the metal towel rack and put it in the white washing machine on the left,\" the DSR is expected to carry the red towel to the washing machine based on the retrieved images. This is challenging because the correct images should be retrieved from thousands of collected images, which may include many images of similar towels and appliances. To address this, we propose RelaX-Former, which learns diverse and robust representations from among positive, unlabeled positive, and negative samples. We evaluated RelaX-Former on a dataset containing real-world indoor images and human annotated instructions including complex referring expressions. The experimental results demonstrate that RelaX-Former outperformed existing baseline models across standard image retrieval metrics.

LE-MCTS formulates step-by-step reasoning with an ensemble of language models as a Markov decision process. In this framework, states represent intermediate reasoning paths, while actions consist of generating the next reasoning step using one of the language models selected from a predefined pool. Guided by a process-based reward model, LE-MCTS performs a tree search over the reasoning steps generated by different language models, identifying the most accurate reasoning chain. Experimental results on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms both single language model decoding algorithms and language model ensemble methods.

Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph.

These assets typically consist of a single, fused representation, like an implicit neural field, a Gaussian mixture, or a mesh, without any useful structure. However, most applications and creative workflows require assets to be made of several meaningful parts that can be manipulated independently. To address this gap, we introduce PartGen, a novel approach that generates 3D objects composed of meaningful parts starting from text, an image, or an unstructured 3D object. First, given multiple views of a 3D object, generated or rendered, a multi-view diffusion model extracts a set of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, dividing the object into parts. Then, a second multi-view diffusion model takes each part separately, fills in the occlusions, and uses those completed views for 3D reconstruction by feeding them to a 3D reconstruction network. This completion process considers the context of the entire object to ensure that the parts integrate cohesively. The generative completion model can make up for the information missing due to occlusions; in extreme cases, it can hallucinate entirely invisible parts based on the input 3D asset. We evaluate our method on generated and real 3D assets and show that it outperforms segmentation and part-extraction baselines by a large margin. We also showcase downstream applications such as 3D part editing.",

However, the current video generation models predominantly focus on single-prompt, struggling to generate coherent scenes with multiple sequential prompts that better reflect real-world dynamic scenarios. While some pioneering works have explored multi-prompt video generation, they face significant challenges including strict training data requirements, weak prompt following, and unnatural transitions. To address these problems, we propose DiTCtrl, a training-free multi-prompt video generation method under MM-DiT architectures for the first time. Our key idea is to take the multi-prompt video generation task as temporal video editing with smooth transitions. To achieve this goal, we first analyze MM-DiT's attention mechanism, finding that the 3D full attention behaves similarly to that of the cross/self-attention blocks in the UNet-like diffusion models, enabling mask-guided precise semantic control across different prompts with attention sharing for multi-prompt video generation. Based on our careful design, the video generated by DiTCtrl achieves smooth transitions and consistent object motion given multiple sequential prompts without additional training. Besides, we also present MPVBench, a new benchmark specially designed for multi-prompt video generation to evaluate the performance of multi-prompt generation.

While existing works mainly address RoPE's limitations within attention mechanism, this paper provides an analysis across nearly all parts of LMs, uncovering their adverse effects on length generalization for RoPE-based attention. Using Discrete Signal Processing theory, we show that RoPE enables periodic attention by implicitly achieving Non-Uniform Discrete Fourier Transform. However, this periodicity is undermined by the spectral damage caused by: 1) linear layers and activation functions outside of attention; 2) insufficiently trained frequency components brought by time-domain truncation. Building on our observations, we propose Fourier Position Embedding (FoPE), which enhances attention's frequency-domain properties to improve both its periodic extension and length generalization. FoPE constructs Fourier Series and zero-outs the destructive frequency components, increasing model robustness against the spectrum damage. Experiments across various model scales show that, within varying context windows, FoPE can maintain a more stable perplexity and a more consistent accuracy in a needle-in-haystack task compared to RoPE and ALiBi.

Our model features two notable strengths: (1) it demonstrates resilience to depth-deficient regions, providing reliable completion for both continuous areas and isolated points, and (2) it faithfully preserves scale consistency with the conditioned known depth when filling in missing values. Drawing on these advantages, our approach proves its worth in various downstream tasks, including 3D scene inpainting, text-to-3D scene generation, sparse-view reconstruction with DUST3R, and LiDAR depth completion, exceeding current solutions in both numerical performance and visual quality.

    "title": "SKETCH: Structured Knowledge Enhanced Text Comprehension for Holistic Retrieval",
    "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become pivotal in leveraging vast corpora to generate informed and contextually relevant responses, notably reducing hallucinations in Large Language Models. Despite significant advancements, these systems struggle to efficiently process and retrieve information from large datasets while maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the context. This paper introduces SKETCH, a novel methodology that enhances the RAG retrieval process by integrating semantic text retrieval with knowledge graphs, thereby merging structured and unstructured data for a more holistic comprehension. SKETCH, demonstrates substantial improvements in retrieval performance and maintains superior context integrity compared to traditional methods. Evaluated across four diverse datasets: QuALITY, QASPER, NarrativeQA, and Italian Cuisine-SKETCH consistently outperforms baseline approaches on key RAGAS metrics such as answer_relevancy, faithfulness, context_precision and context_recall. Notably, on the Italian Cuisine dataset, SKETCH achieved an answer relevancy of 0.94 and a context precision of 0.99, representing the highest performance across all evaluated metrics. These results highlight SKETCH's capability in delivering more accurate and contextually relevant responses, setting new benchmarks for future retrieval systems.",
