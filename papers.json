    "title": "How Good Are We? Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00078v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, \"How good are we?\", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, \"How can we improve?\", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00128v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Exploring the intricate dynamics between muscular and skeletal structures is pivotal for understanding human motion. This domain presents substantial challenges, primarily attributed to the intensive resources required for acquiring ground truth muscle activation data, resulting in a scarcity of datasets. In this work, we address this issue by establishing Muscles in Time (MinT), a large-scale synthetic muscle activation dataset. For the creation of MinT, we enriched existing motion capture datasets by incorporating muscle activation simulations derived from biomechanical human body models using the OpenSim platform, a common approach in biomechanics and human motion research. Starting from simple pose sequences, our pipeline enables us to extract detailed information about the timing of muscle activations within the human musculoskeletal system. Muscles in Time contains over nine hours of simulation data covering 227 subjects and 402 simulated muscle strands. We demonstrate the utility of this dataset by presenting results on neural network-based muscle activation estimation from human pose sequences with two different sequence-to-sequence architectures.

    "title": "Self-Ensembling Gaussian Splatting for Few-shot Novel View Synthesis",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00144v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness for novel view synthesis (NVS). However, the 3DGS model tends to overfit when trained with sparse posed views, limiting its generalization capacity for broader pose variations. In this paper, we alleviate the overfitting problem by introducing a self-ensembling Gaussian Splatting (SE-GS) approach. We present two Gaussian Splatting models named the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and the $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model. The $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model serves as the primary model that generates novel-view images during inference. At the training stage, the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model is guided away from specific local optima by an uncertainty-aware perturbing strategy. We dynamically perturb the $\\mathbf{\\Delta}$-model based on the uncertainties of novel-view renderings across different training steps, resulting in diverse temporal models sampled from the Gaussian parameter space without additional training costs. The geometry of the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model is regularized by penalizing discrepancies between the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model and the temporal samples. Therefore, our SE-GS conducts an effective and efficient regularization across a large number of Gaussian Splatting models, resulting in a robust ensemble, the $\\mathbf{\\Sigma}$-model. Experimental results on the LLFF, Mip-NeRF360, DTU, and MVImgNet datasets show that our approach improves NVS quality with few-shot training views, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods.

    "title": "NIMBA: Towards Robust and Principled Processing of Point Clouds With SSMs",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00151v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Transformers have become dominant in large-scale deep learning tasks across various domains, including text, 2D and 3D vision. However, the quadratic complexity of their attention mechanism limits their efficiency as the sequence length increases, particularly in high-resolution 3D data such as point clouds. Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as promising alternatives, offering linear complexity, scalability, and high performance in long-sequence tasks. The key challenge in the application of SSMs in this domain lies in reconciling the non-sequential structure of point clouds with the inherently directional (or bi-directional) order-dependent processing of recurrent models like Mamba. To achieve this, previous research proposed reorganizing point clouds along multiple directions or predetermined paths in 3D space, concatenating the results to produce a single 1D sequence capturing different views. In our work, we introduce a method to convert point clouds into 1D sequences that maintain 3D spatial structure with no need for data replication, allowing Mamba sequential processing to be applied effectively in an almost permutation-invariant manner. In contrast to other works, we found that our method does not require positional embeddings and allows for shorter sequence lengths while still achieving state-of-the-art results in ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets and surpassing Transformer-based models in both accuracy and efficiency.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00158v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In smart cities, it is common practice to define a maximum length of stay for a given parking space to increase the space's rotativity and discourage the usage of individual transportation solutions. However, automatically determining individual car dwell times from images faces challenges, such as images collected from low-resolution cameras, lighting variations, and weather effects. In this work, we propose a method that combines two deep neural networks to compute the dwell time of each car in a parking lot. The proposed method first defines the parking space status between occupied and empty using a deep classification network. Then, it uses a Siamese network to check if the parked car is the same as the previous image. Using an experimental protocol that focuses on a cross-dataset scenario, we show that if a perfect classifier is used, the proposed system generates 75% of perfect dwell time predictions, where the predicted value matched exactly the time the car stayed parked. Nevertheless, our experiments show a drop in prediction quality when a real-world classifier is used to predict the parking space statuses, reaching 49% of perfect predictions, showing that the proposed Siamese network is promising but impacted by the quality of the classifier used at the beginning of the pipeline.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00164v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Utilizing patch-based transformers for unstructured geometric data such as polygon meshes presents significant challenges, primarily due to the absence of a canonical ordering and variations in input sizes. Prior approaches to handling 3D meshes and point clouds have either relied on computationally intensive node-level tokens for large objects or resorted to resampling to standardize patch size. Moreover, these methods generally lack a geometry-aware, stable Structural Embedding (SE), often depending on simplistic absolute SEs such as 3D coordinates, which compromise isometry invariance essential for tasks like semantic segmentation. In our study, we meticulously examine the various components of a geometry-aware 3D mesh transformer, from tokenization to structural encoding, assessing the contribution of each. Initially, we introduce a spectral-preserving tokenization rooted in algebraic multigrid methods. Subsequently, we detail an approach for embedding features at the patch level, accommodating patches with variable node counts. Through comparative analyses against a baseline model employing simple point-wise Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP), our research highlights critical insights: 1) the importance of structural and positional embeddings facilitated by heat diffusion in general 3D mesh transformers; 2) the effectiveness of novel components such as geodesic masking and feature interaction via cross-attention in enhancing learning; and 3) the superior performance and efficiency of our proposed methods in challenging segmentation and classification tasks.",

Through image classification, it is possible to expedite search and rescue initiatives by classifying flood zones, including houses and humans. We create a new dataset collecting aerial imagery of flooding events across South Asian countries. For the classification, we propose a fine-tuned Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) based approach and some other cutting-edge transformer-based and Convolutional Neural Network-based architectures (CNN). We also implement the YOLOv8 object detection model and detect houses and humans within the imagery of our proposed dataset, and then compare the performance with our classification-based approach. Since the countries in South Asia have similar topography, housing structure, the color of flood water, and vegetation, this work can be more applicable to such a region as opposed to the rest of the world. The images are divided evenly into four classes: 'flood', 'flood with domicile', 'flood with humans', and 'no flood'. After experimenting with our proposed dataset on our fine-tuned CCT model, which has a comparatively lower number of weight parameters than many other transformer-based architectures designed for computer vision, it exhibits an accuracy and macro average precision of 98.62% and 98.50%. The other transformer-based architectures that we implement are the Vision Transformer (ViT), Swin Transformer, and External Attention Transformer (EANet), which give an accuracy of 88.66%, 84.74%, and 66.56% respectively. We also implement DCECNN (Deep Custom Ensembled Convolutional Neural Network), which is a custom ensemble model that we create by combining MobileNet, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0, and we obtain an accuracy of 98.78%.

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights.

This estimation guides essential driving decisions, such as braking before an obstacle or changing lanes to avoid collisions. In this paper, we explore vulnerabilities of MDE algorithms in AD systems, presenting LensAttack, a novel physical attack that strategically places optical lenses on the camera of an autonomous vehicle to manipulate the perceived object depths. LensAttack encompasses two attack formats: concave lens attack and convex lens attack, each utilizing different optical lenses to induce false depth perception. We first develop a mathematical model that outlines the parameters of the attack, followed by simulations and real-world evaluations to assess its efficacy on state-of-the-art MDE models. Additionally, we adopt an attack optimization method to further enhance the attack success rate by optimizing the attack focal length. To better evaluate the implications of LensAttack on AD, we conduct comprehensive end-to-end system simulations using the CARLA platform. The results reveal that LensAttack can significantly disrupt the depth estimation processes in AD systems, posing a serious threat to their reliability and safety.

It evaluates their performance on three diverse datasets: Traffic Signs (with varying object sizes), African Wildlife (with diverse aspect ratios and at least one instance of the object per image), and Ships and Vessels (with small-sized objects of a single class), ensuring a comprehensive assessment across datasets with distinct challenges. To ensure a robust evaluation, we employ a comprehensive set of metrics, including Precision, Recall, Mean Average Precision (mAP), Processing Time, GFLOPs count, and Model Size. Our analysis highlights the distinctive strengths and limitations of each YOLO version. For example: YOLOv9 demonstrates substantial accuracy but struggles with detecting small objects and efficiency whereas YOLOv10 exhibits relatively lower accuracy due to architectural choices that affect its performance in overlapping object detection but excels in speed and efficiency. Additionally, the YOLO11 family consistently shows superior performance in terms of accuracy, speed, computational efficiency, and model size. YOLO11m achieved a remarkable balance of accuracy and efficiency, scoring mAP50-95 scores of 0.795, 0.81, and 0.325 on the Traffic Signs, African Wildlife, and Ships datasets, respectively, while maintaining an average inference time of 2.4ms, a model size of 38.8Mb, and around 67.6 GFLOPs on average.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00239v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Representing underwater 3D scenes is a valuable yet complex task, as attenuation and scattering effects during underwater imaging significantly couple the information of the objects and the water. This coupling presents a significant challenge for existing methods in effectively representing both the objects and the water medium simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose Aquatic-GS, a hybrid 3D representation approach for underwater scenes that effectively represents both the objects and the water medium. Specifically, we construct a Neural Water Field (NWF) to implicitly model the water parameters, while extending the latest 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to model the objects explicitly. Both components are integrated through a physics-based underwater image formation model to represent complex underwater scenes. Moreover, to construct more precise scene geometry and details, we design a Depth-Guided Optimization (DGO) mechanism that uses a pseudo-depth map as auxiliary guidance. After optimization, Aquatic-GS enables the rendering of novel underwater viewpoints and supports restoring the true appearance of underwater scenes, as if the water medium were absent. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that Aquatic-GS surpasses state-of-the-art underwater 3D representation methods, achieving better rendering quality and real-time rendering performance with a 410x increase in speed. Furthermore, regarding underwater image restoration, Aquatic-GS outperforms representative dewatering methods in color correction, detail recovery, and stability.

In this paper, we analyze this phenomenon in vision transformers, focusing on the spectral geometry of residuals, and explore its implications for modality alignment in vision-language models. First, we link it to the intrinsically low-dimensional structure of visual head representations, zooming into their principal components and showing that they encode specialized roles across a wide variety of input data distributions. Then, we analyze the effect of head specialization in multimodal models, focusing on how improved alignment between text and specialized heads impacts zero-shot classification performance. This specialization-performance link consistently holds across diverse pre-training data, network sizes, and objectives, demonstrating a powerful new mechanism for boosting zero-shot classification through targeted alignment. Ultimately, we translate these insights into actionable terms by introducing ResiDual, a technique for spectral alignment of the residual stream. Much like panning for gold, it lets the noise from irrelevant unit principal components (i.e., attributes) wash away to amplify task-relevant ones. Remarkably, this dual perspective on modality alignment yields fine-tuning level performances on different data distributions while modeling an extremely interpretable and parameter-efficient transformation, as we extensively show on more than 50 (pre-trained network, dataset) pairs.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00252v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Transformers and their derivatives have achieved state-of-the-art performance across text, vision, and speech recognition tasks. However, minimal effort has been made to train transformers capable of evaluating the output quality of other models. This paper examines SwinV2-based reward models, called the Input-Output Transformer (IO Transformer) and the Output Transformer. These reward models can be leveraged for tasks such as inference quality evaluation, data categorization, and policy optimization. Our experiments demonstrate highly accurate model output quality assessment across domains where the output is entirely dependent on the input, with the IO Transformer achieving perfect evaluation accuracy on the Change Dataset 25 (CD25). We also explore modified Swin V2 architectures. Ultimately Swin V2 remains on top with a score of 95.41 % on the IO Segmentation Dataset, outperforming the IO Transformer in scenarios where the output is not entirely dependent on the input. Our work expands the application of transformer architectures to reward modeling in computer vision and provides critical insights into optimizing these models for various tasks.",

    "title": "Adaptive Residual Transformation for Enhanced Feature-Based OOD Detection in SAR Imagery",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00274v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recent advances in deep learning architectures have enabled efficient and accurate classification of pre-trained targets in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. Nevertheless, the presence of unknown targets in real battlefield scenarios is unavoidable, resulting in misclassification and reducing the accuracy of the classifier. Over the past decades, various feature-based out-of-distribution (OOD) approaches have been developed to address this issue, yet defining the decision boundary between known and unknown targets remains challenging. Additionally, unlike optical images, detecting unknown targets in SAR imagery is further complicated by high speckle noise, the presence of clutter, and the inherent similarities in back-scattered microwave signals. In this work, we propose transforming feature-based OOD detection into a class-localized feature-residual-based approach, demonstrating that this method can improve stability across varying unknown targets' distribution conditions. Transforming feature-based OOD detection into a residual-based framework offers a more robust reference space for distinguishing between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data, particularly within the unique characteristics of SAR imagery. This adaptive residual transformation method standardizes feature-based inputs into distributional representations, enhancing OOD detection in noisy, low-information images. Our approach demonstrates promising performance in real-world SAR scenarios, effectively adapting to the high levels of noise and clutter inherent in these environments. These findings highlight the practical relevance of residual-based OOD detection for SAR applications and suggest a foundation for further advancements in unknown target detection in complex, operational settings.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00281v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Automated detection of chemical plumes presents a segmentation challenge. The segmentation problem for gas plumes is difficult due to the diffusive nature of the cloud. The advantage of considering hyperspectral images in the gas plume detection problem over the conventional RGB imagery is the presence of non-visual data, allowing for a richer representation of information. In this paper we present an effective method of visualizing hyperspectral video sequences containing chemical plumes and investigate the effectiveness of segmentation techniques on these post-processed videos. Our approach uses a combination of dimension reduction and histogram equalization to prepare the hyperspectral videos for segmentation. First, Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimension of the entire video sequence. This is done by projecting each pixel onto the first few Principal Components resulting in a type of spectral filter. Next, a Midway method for histogram equalization is used. These methods redistribute the intensity values in order to reduce flicker between frames. This properly prepares these high-dimensional video sequences for more traditional segmentation techniques. We compare the ability of various clustering techniques to properly segment the chemical plume. These include K-means, spectral clustering, and the Ginzburg-Landau functional.",

While current Vision Language Models (VLMs) show promise, they are prone to generating hallucinations, potentially compromising patient care. We introduce RadFlag, a black-box method to enhance the accuracy of radiology report generation. Our method uses a sampling-based flagging technique to find hallucinatory generations that should be removed. We first sample multiple reports at varying temperatures and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify claims that are not consistently supported across samples, indicating that the model has low confidence in those claims. Using a calibrated threshold, we flag a fraction of these claims as likely hallucinations, which should undergo extra review or be automatically rejected. Our method achieves high precision when identifying both individual hallucinatory sentences and reports that contain hallucinations. As an easy-to-use, black-box system that only requires access to a model's temperature parameter, RadFlag is compatible with a wide range of radiology report generation models and has the potential to broadly improve the quality of automated radiology reporting.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00304v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent times, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been trained under two predominant paradigms. Generative training has enabled Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to tackle various complex tasks, yet issues such as hallucinations and weak object discrimination persist. Discriminative training, exemplified by models like CLIP, excels in zero-shot image-text classification and retrieval, yet struggles with complex scenarios requiring fine-grained semantic differentiation. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a unified approach that integrates the strengths of both paradigms. Considering interleaved image-text sequences as the general format of input samples, we introduce a structure-induced training strategy that imposes semantic relationships between input samples and the MLLM's hidden state. This approach enhances the MLLM's ability to capture global semantics and distinguish fine-grained semantics. By leveraging dynamic sequence alignment within the Dynamic Time Warping framework and integrating a novel kernel for fine-grained semantic differentiation, our method effectively balances generative and discriminative tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple generative tasks, especially those requiring cognitive and discrimination abilities. Additionally, our method surpasses discriminative benchmarks in interleaved and fine-grained retrieval tasks. By employing a retrieval-augmented generation strategy, our approach further enhances performance in some generative tasks within one model, offering a promising direction for future research in vision-language modeling.",

The primary challenge in this field is to overcome the complex interplay between intra-class and inter-class variations and to identify features that remain unaffected by changes in appearance. Sufficient data collection for model training would significantly aid in addressing this problem. However, it is challenging to gather diverse datasets in practice. Current methods focus on implicitly learning identity information from the original image or introducing additional auxiliary models, which are largely limited by the quality of the image and the performance of the additional model. To address these issues, inspired by prompt learning, we propose a novel multiple information prompt learning (MIPL) scheme for cloth-changing person ReID, which learns identity robust features through the common prompt guidance of multiple messages. Specifically, the clothing information stripping (CIS) module is designed to decouple the clothing information from the original RGB image features to counteract the influence of clothing appearance. The Bio-guided attention (BGA) module is proposed to increase the learning intensity of the model for key information. A dual-length hybrid patch (DHP) module is employed to make the features have diverse coverage to minimize the impact of feature bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on the LTCC, Celeb-reID, Celeb-reID-light, and CSCC datasets, achieving rank-1 scores of 74.8%, 73.3%, 66.0%, and 88.1%, respectively.

TextDestroyer addresses these issues by employing a three-stage hierarchical process to obtain accurate text masks. Our method scrambles text areas in the latent start code using a Gaussian distribution before reconstruction. During the diffusion denoising process, self-attention key and value are referenced from the original latent to restore the compromised background. Latent codes saved at each inversion step are used for replacement during reconstruction, ensuring perfect background restoration. The advantages of TextDestroyer include: (1) it eliminates labor-intensive data annotation and resource-intensive training; (2) it achieves more thorough text destruction, preventing recognizable traces; and (3) it demonstrates better generalization capabilities, performing well on both real-world scenes and generated images.",

In contrast, Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically generate direct, one-shot responses without evaluating the sufficiency of the information. To investigate this gap, we identify a critical and challenging task in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) scenario: can VLMs indicate how to adjust an image when the visual information is insufficient to answer a question? This capability is especially valuable for assisting visually impaired individuals who often need guidance to capture images correctly. To evaluate this capability of current VLMs, we introduce a human-labeled dataset as a benchmark for this task. Additionally, we present an automated framework that generates synthetic training data by simulating ``where to know'' scenarios.

Although diffusion-based 3D texture generation methods, such as distillation sampling, have numerous promising applications in stylized games and films, it requires addressing two challenges: 1) decouple style and content completely from the reference image for 3D models, and 2) align the generated texture with the color tone, style of the reference image, and the given text prompt. To this end, we introduce StyleTex, an innovative diffusion-model-based framework for creating stylized textures for 3D models. Our key insight is to decouple style information from the reference image while disregarding content in diffusion-based distillation sampling. Specifically, given a reference image, we first decompose its style feature from the image CLIP embedding by subtracting the embedding's orthogonal projection in the direction of the content feature, which is represented by a text CLIP embedding. Our novel approach to disentangling the reference image's style and content information allows us to generate distinct style and content features. We then inject the style feature into the cross-attention mechanism to incorporate it into the generation process, while utilizing the content feature as a negative prompt to further dissociate content information. Finally, we incorporate these strategies into StyleTex to obtain stylized textures. The resulting textures generated by StyleTex retain the style of the reference image, while also aligning with the text prompts and intrinsic details of the given 3D mesh. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing baseline methods by a significant margin.",

To overcome these issues, we propose a frequency-domain approach that directly predicts Wigner-D coefficients for 3D rotation regression, aligning with the operations of spherical CNNs. Our SO(3)-equivariant pose harmonics predictor overcomes the limitations of spatial parameterizations, ensuring consistent pose estimation under arbitrary rotations. Trained with a frequency-domain regression loss, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks such as ModelNet10-SO(3) and PASCAL3D+, with significant improvements in accuracy, robustness, and data efficiency.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00548v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In automated crop protection tasks such as weed control, disease diagnosis, and pest monitoring, deep learning has demonstrated significant potential. However, these advanced models rely heavily on high-quality, diverse datasets, often limited and costly in agricultural settings. Traditional data augmentation can increase dataset volume but usually lacks the real-world variability needed for robust training. This study presents a new approach for generating synthetic images to improve deep learning-based object detection models for intelligent weed control. Our GenAI-based image generation pipeline integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for zero-shot domain adaptation with a text-to-image Stable Diffusion Model, enabling the creation of synthetic images that capture diverse real-world conditions. We evaluate these synthetic datasets using lightweight YOLO models, measuring data efficiency with mAP50 and mAP50-95 scores across varying proportions of real and synthetic data. Notably, YOLO models trained on datasets with 10% synthetic and 90% real images generally demonstrate superior mAP50 and mAP50-95 scores compared to those trained solely on real images. This approach not only reduces dependence on extensive real-world datasets but also enhances predictive performance. The integration of this approach opens opportunities for achieving continual self-improvement of perception modules in intelligent technical systems.",

In microbial live-cell imaging (MLCI), a few to thousands of cells have to be detected and tracked within dozens of growing cell colonies. The challenge of tracking cells is heavily influenced by the experiment parameters, namely the imaging interval and maximal cell number. For now, tracking benchmarks are not widely available in MLCI and the effect of these parameters on the tracking performance are not yet known. Therefore, we present the largest publicly available and annotated dataset for MLCI, containing more than 1.4 million cell instances, 29k cell tracks, and 14k cell divisions. With this dataset at hand, we generalize existing tracking metrics to incorporate relevant imaging and experiment parameters into experiment-aware metrics. These metrics reveal that current cell tracking methods crucially depend on the choice of the experiment parameters, where their performance deteriorates at high imaging intervals and large cell colonies. Thus, our new benchmark quantifies the influence of experiment parameters on the tracking quality, and gives the opportunity to develop new data-driven methods that generalize across imaging and experiment parameters.

In response to these challenges, we introduce Parameter-efficient Scenario-specific Tracking Architecture (PASTA), a novel framework that combines Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Modular Deep Learning (MDL). Specifically, we define key scenario attributes (e.g, camera-viewpoint, lighting condition) and train specialized PEFT modules for each attribute. These expert modules are combined in parameter space, enabling systematic generalization to new domains without increasing inference time.

Ocular images can be used for early diagnosis by segmenting different regions, such as the sclera, iris, and pupil, which allows for the calculation of area ratios to support accurate medical assessments. However, no publicly available dataset and tools currently exist for this purpose. To address this, we propose a new topology and intersection-union constrained loss function (TIU loss) that improves performance using small training datasets. We conducted experiments on a public dataset consisting of 55 subjects and 2,197 images. Our proposed method outperformed two widely used loss functions across three deep learning networks, achieving a mean Dice score of 83.12% [82.47%, 83.81%] with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval. In a low-percentage training scenario (10% of the training data), our approach showed an 8.32% improvement in Dice score compared to the baseline. Additionally, we evaluated the method in a clinical setting with 47 subjects and 501 images, achieving a Dice score of 64.44% [63.22%, 65.62%].

Despite its wide application in robotics, autonomous driving, and smart manufacturing, there is limited literature addressing the specific challenges of running MOT on embedded devices. State-of-the-art MOT trackers designed for high-end GPUs often experience low processing rates (<11fps) when deployed on embedded devices. Existing MOT frameworks for embedded devices proposed strategies such as fusing the detector model with the feature embedding model to reduce inference latency or combining different trackers to improve tracking accuracy, but tend to compromise one for the other. This paper introduces HopTrack, a real-time multi-object tracking system tailored for embedded devices. Our system employs a novel discretized static and dynamic matching approach along with an innovative content-aware dynamic sampling technique to enhance tracking accuracy while meeting the real-time requirement. Compared with the best high-end GPU modified baseline Byte (Embed) and the best existing baseline on embedded devices MobileNet-JDE, HopTrack achieves a processing speed of up to 39.29 fps on NVIDIA AGX Xavier with a multi-object tracking accuracy (MOTA) of up to 63.12% on the MOT16 benchmark, outperforming both counterparts by 2.15% and 4.82%, respectively.

However, as the scale of these models increases, catastrophic forgetting remains a persistent challenge, particularly in the presence of significant domain shifts across tasks. Recent studies highlight a crossover between CL techniques and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which focuses on fine-tuning only a small set of trainable parameters to adapt to downstream tasks, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA). While LoRA achieves faster convergence and requires fewer trainable parameters, it has seldom been explored in the context of continual learning. To address this gap, we propose a novel PEFT-CL method called Dual Low-Rank Adaptation (DualLoRA), which introduces both an orthogonal LoRA adapter and a residual LoRA adapter parallel to pre-trained weights in each layer. These components are orchestrated by a dynamic memory mechanism to strike a balance between stability and plasticity. The orthogonal LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in an orthogonal subspace of previous tasks to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, while the residual LoRA adapter's parameters are updated in the residual subspace spanned by task-specific bases without interaction across tasks, offering complementary capabilities for fine-tuning new tasks. On ViT-based models, we demonstrate that DualLoRA offers significant advantages in accuracy, inference speed, and memory efficiency over existing CL methods across multiple benchmarks.",

Then, GSFS dynamically shifts the testing sample toward the source domain, mitigating error accumulation in an online manner. In addition, CPR is proposed to pull the nearest learnable prototype close to the testing feature and push it away from other prototypes, making each prototype distinguishable during the adaptation.

However, it has so far been necessary to train these models from scratch, which is increasingly infeasible in the era of large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, inspired by the architectural similarities in standard DNNs and B-cos networks, we propose 'B-cosification', a novel approach to transform existing pre-trained models to become inherently interpretable. We perform a thorough study of design choices to perform this conversion, both for convolutional neural networks and vision transformers. We find that B-cosification can yield models that are on par with B-cos models trained from scratch in terms of interpretability, while often outperforming them in terms of classification performance at a fraction of the training cost. Subsequently, we apply B-cosification to a pretrained CLIP model, and show that, even with limited data and compute cost, we obtain a B-cosified version that is highly interpretable and competitive on zero shot performance across a variety of datasets.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.00729v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: This paper presents an autonomous method to address challenges arising from severe lighting conditions in machine vision applications that use event cameras. To manage these conditions, the research explores the built in potential of these cameras to adjust pixel functionality, named bias settings. As cars are driven at various times and locations, shifts in lighting conditions are unavoidable. Consequently, this paper utilizes the neuromorphic YOLO-based face tracking module of a driver monitoring system as the event-based application to study. The proposed method uses numerical metrics to continuously monitor the performance of the event-based application in real-time. When the application malfunctions, the system detects this through a drop in the metrics and automatically adjusts the event cameras bias values. The Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm is employed to optimize this adjustment, with finetuning continuing until performance returns to a satisfactory level. The advantage of bias optimization lies in its ability to handle conditions such as flickering or darkness without requiring additional hardware or software. To demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed system, it was tested under conditions where detecting human faces with default bias values was impossible. These severe conditions were simulated using dim ambient light and various flickering frequencies. Following the automatic and dynamic process of bias modification, the metrics for face detection significantly improved under all conditions. Autobiasing resulted in an increase in the YOLO confidence indicators by more than 33 percent for object detection and 37 percent for face detection highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Additionally, many methods require supplementary data such as facial landmarks and masks to guide the synthesis process. In contrast, our approach uses diffusion models with only a reconstruction loss, eliminating the need for facial landmarks or masks while still producing images with intricate, fine-grained details. We validated our results on two public benchmarks through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three key areas: identity anonymization, facial attribute preservation, and image quality. Beyond its primary function of anonymization, our model can also perform face swapping tasks by incorporating an additional facial image as input, demonstrating its versatility and potential for diverse applications.

Additionally, it provides interactive controllability, predicting and altering future content based on the current clip, thus allowing for gameplay simulation. To realize this vision, we first collected and built an Open-World Video Game Dataset from scratch.

GameGen-X undergoes a two-stage training process, consisting of foundation model pre-training and instruction tuning. Firstly, the model was pre-trained via text-to-video generation and video continuation, endowing it with the capability for long-sequence, high-quality open-domain game video generation. Further, to achieve interactive controllability, we designed InstructNet to incorporate game-related multi-modal control signal experts. This allows the model to adjust latent representations based on user inputs, unifying character interaction and scene content control for the first time in video generation.

Specifically, we implement a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique to eliminate blurry artifacts and accelerate convergence. To scale up, we introduce an elongation filter that mitigates Gaussian count explosion caused by 2DGS degeneration. Furthermore, we optimize the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10$\\times$ compression, at least 25% savings in training time, and a 50% decrease in memory usage.

The proposed RAR is simple: during a standard autoregressive training process with a next-token prediction objective, the input sequence-typically ordered in raster form-is randomly permuted into different factorization orders with a probability r, where r starts at 1 and linearly decays to 0 over the course of training. This annealing training strategy enables the model to learn to maximize the expected likelihood over all factorization orders and thus effectively improve the model's capability of modeling bidirectional contexts. Importantly, RAR preserves the integrity of the autoregressive modeling framework, ensuring full compatibility with language modeling while significantly improving performance in image generation. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, RAR achieves an FID score of 1.48, not only surpassing prior state-of-the-art autoregressive image generators but also outperforming leading diffusion-based and masked transformer-based methods.

To adapt LMMs for downstream tasks, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which only trains additional prefix tokens or modules, has gained popularity. Nevertheless, there has been little analysis of how PEFT works in LMMs. In this paper, we delve into the strengths and weaknesses of each tuning strategy, shifting the focus from the efficiency typically associated with these approaches. We first discover that model parameter tuning methods such as LoRA and Adapters distort the feature representation space learned during pre-training and limit the full utilization of pre-trained knowledge. We also demonstrate that prefix-tuning excels at preserving the representation space, despite its lower performance on downstream tasks. These findings suggest a simple two-step PEFT strategy called Prefix-Tuned PEFT (PT-PEFT), which successively performs prefix-tuning and then PEFT (i.e., Adapter, LoRA), combines the benefits of both. Experimental results show that PT-PEFT not only improves performance in image captioning and visual question answering compared to vanilla PEFT methods but also helps preserve the representation space of the four pre-trained models.",

For the safe deployment of foundation models, there is a pressing need to ensure double-correct predictions, i.e., correct prediction backed by correct rationales. To achieve this, we propose a two-phase scheme: First, we curate a new dataset that offers structured rationales for visual recognition tasks. Second, we propose a rationale-informed optimization method to guide the model in disentangling and localizing visual evidence for each rationale, without requiring manual annotations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 10.1% in prediction accuracy across a wide range of tasks.

Several adversarial attacks can create such examples, each with a different perspective, effectiveness, and perceptibility of changes. Conversely, defending against such adversarial attacks improves the robustness of ML models in image processing and other domains of deep learning. Most defence mechanisms require either a level of model awareness, changes to the model, or access to a comprehensive set of adversarial examples during training, which is impractical. Another option is to use an auxiliary model in a preprocessing manner without changing the primary model. This study presents a practical and effective solution -- using predictive coding networks (PCnets) as an auxiliary step for adversarial defence. By seamlessly integrating PCnets into feed-forward networks as a preprocessing step, we substantially bolster resilience to adversarial perturbations. Our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR10 demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of PCnets in mitigating adversarial examples with about 82% and 65% improvements in robustness, respectively. The PCnet, trained on a small subset of the dataset, leverages its generative nature to effectively counter adversarial efforts, reverting perturbed images closer to their original forms. This innovative approach holds promise for enhancing the security and reliability of neural network classifiers in the face of the escalating threat of adversarial attacks.",

To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.",

In particular, Deep learning (DL) models have continued to offer important solutions for early BM diagnosis but their performance experiences overfitting due to the limited volume of breast ultrasound (BUS) image data. Further, large BUS datasets are difficult to manage due to privacy and legal concerns. Hence, image augmentation is a necessary and challenging step to improve the performance of the DL models. However, the current DL-based augmentation models are inadequate and operate as a black box resulting lack of information and justifications about their suitability and efficacy. Additionally, pre and post-augmentation need high-performance computational resources and time to produce the augmented image and evaluate the model performance. Thus, this study aims to develop a novel efficient augmentation approach for BUS images with advanced neural style transfer (NST) and Explainable AI (XAI) harnessing GPU-based parallel infrastructure. We scale and distribute the training of the augmentation model across 8 GPUs using the Horovod framework on a DGX cluster, achieving a 5.09 speedup while maintaining the model's accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on 800 (348 benign and 452 malignant) BUS images and its performance is analyzed with other progressive techniques, using different quantitative analyses.

This paper lays the foundations for such applications by evaluating the accuracy of zero-shot prompting of VLMs on graphical perception tasks with established human performance profiles. Our findings reveal that VLMs perform similarly to humans under specific task and style combinations, suggesting that they have the potential to be used for modeling human performance.

However, we observe that modeling with constant velocity and using reflow procedures have limitations in accurately learning straight trajectories between pairs, resulting in suboptimal performance in few-step generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework based on a simple constant acceleration equation. CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, allowing for more expressive and accurate estimation of the ODE flow.

As a result, it often has difficulty representing high-frequency shadows and shading. In this paper, we propose a two-stage relighting method that can reproduce physically-based shadows and shading from low to high frequencies. The key idea is to approximate an environment light source with a set of a fixed number of area light sources. The first stage employs supervised inverse rendering from a single image using neural networks and calculates physically-based shading. The second stage then calculates shadow for each area light and sums up to render the final image. We propose to make soft shadow mapping differentiable for the area-light approximation of environment lighting. We demonstrate that our method can plausibly reproduce all-frequency shadows and shading caused by environment illumination, which have been difficult to reproduce using existing methods.",

The challenge of incremental learning lies in achieving an optimal balance between plasticity, the ability to learn new knowledge, and stability, the ability to retain old knowledge. Based on whether the task identifier (task-ID) of an image can be obtained during the test stage, incremental learning for image classifcation is divided into two main paradigms, which are task incremental learning (TIL) and class incremental learning (CIL). The TIL paradigm has access to the task-ID, allowing it to use multiple task-specific classification heads selected based on the task-ID. Consequently, in CIL, where the task-ID is unavailable, TIL methods must predict the task-ID to extend their application to the CIL paradigm. Our previous method for TIL adds task-specific batch normalization and classification heads incrementally. This work extends the method by predicting task-ID through an \"unknown\" class added to each classification head. The head with the lowest \"unknown\" probability is selected, enabling task-ID prediction and making the method applicable to CIL. The task-specific batch normalization (BN) modules effectively adjust the distribution of output feature maps across different tasks, enhancing the model's plasticity.Moreover, since BN has much fewer parameters compared to convolutional kernels, by only modifying the BN layers as new tasks arrive, the model can effectively manage parameter growth while ensuring stability across tasks. The innovation of this study lies in the first-time introduction of task-specific BN into CIL and verifying the feasibility of extending TIL methods to CIL through task-ID prediction with state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets.",

Despite this, there is still little research done at the intersection of optical depth sensors and radars operating close range, where the target is decimeters away from the sensors. Together with a growing interest in high-resolution imaging radars operating in the near field, the question arises how these sensors behave in comparison to their traditional optical counterparts.\n  In this work, we take on the unique challenge of jointly characterizing depth imagers from both, the optical and radio-frequency domain using a multimodal spatial calibration. We collect data from four depth imagers, with three optical sensors of varying operation principle and an imaging radar. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of their depth measurements with respect to distinct object materials, geometries, and object-to-sensor distances. Specifically, we reveal scattering effects of partially transmissive materials and investigate the response of radio-frequency signals. All object measurements will be made public in form of a multimodal dataset, called MAROON.",

Materials and methods: In-house postoperative CTs from pediatric patients with renal tumors and neuroblastoma (n=189) and a public dataset (n=189) with CTs covering thoracoabdominal regions were used. Seventeen OARs were delineated: nine by clinicians (Type 1) and eight using TotalSegmentator (Type 2). Auto-segmentation models were trained using in-house (ModelPMC-UMCU) and a combined dataset of public data (Model-Combined). Performance was assessed with Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95), and mean surface distance (MSD). Two clinicians rated clinical acceptability on a 5-point Likert scale across 15 patient contours. Model robustness was evaluated against sex, age, intravenous contrast, and tumor type. Results: Model-PMC-UMCU achieved mean DSC values above 0.95 for five of nine OARs, while spleen and heart ranged between 0.90 and 0.95. The stomach-bowel and pancreas exhibited DSC values below 0.90. Model-Combined demonstrated improved robustness across both datasets. Clinical evaluation revealed good usability, with both clinicians rating six of nine Type 1 OARs above four and six of eight Type 2 OARs above three. Significant performance 2 differences were only found across age groups in both datasets, specifically in the left lung and pancreas. The 0-2 age group showed the lowest performance. Conclusion: A multi-organ segmentation model was developed, showcasing enhanced robustness when trained on combined datasets. This model is suitable for various OARs and can be applied to multiple datasets in clinical settings.",

That is mainly due to the fact that the features contributing to a model's prediction are unclear to radiologists and hence, clinically irrelevant, i.e., lack of explainability. As the invaluable sources of radiologists' knowledge and expertise, radiology reports can be integrated with MRI in a contrastive learning (CL) framework, enabling learning from image-report associations, to improve CNN explainability. In this work, we train a multimodal CL architecture on 3D brain MRI scans and radiology reports to learn informative MRI representations. Furthermore, we integrate tumor location, salient to several brain tumor analysis tasks, into this framework to improve its generalizability. We then apply the learnt image representations to improve explainability and performance of genetic marker classification of pediatric Low-grade Glioma, the most prevalent brain tumor in children, as a downstream task. Our results indicate a Dice score of 31.1% between the model's attention maps and manual tumor segmentation (as an explainability measure) with test classification performance of 87.7%, significantly outperforming the baselines. These enhancements can build trust in our model among radiologists, facilitating its integration into clinical practices for more efficient tumor diagnosis.",

In the dynamic visual world, it is crucial for AI systems to continuously detect new objects and establish their relationships with existing ones. Recently, numerous studies have focused on continual learning within the domains of object detection and image recognition. However, a limited amount of research focuses on a more challenging continual learning problem in SGG. This increased difficulty arises from the intricate interactions and dynamic relationships among objects, and their associated contexts. Thus, in continual learning, SGG models are often required to expand, modify, retain, and reason scene graphs within the process of adaptive visual scene understanding. To systematically explore Continual Scene Graph Generation (CSEGG), we present a comprehensive benchmark comprising three learning regimes: relationship incremental, scene incremental, and relationship generalization. Moreover, we introduce a ``Replays via Analysis by Synthesis\" method named RAS. This approach leverages the scene graphs, decomposes and re-composes them to represent different scenes, and replays the synthesized scenes based on these compositional scene graphs. The replayed synthesized scenes act as a means to practice and refine proficiency in SGG in known and unknown environments. Our experimental results not only highlight the challenges of directly combining existing continual learning methods with SGG backbones but also demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, enhancing CSEGG efficiency while simultaneously preserving privacy and memory usage.

    "title": "From Question to Exploration: Test-Time Adaptation in Semantic Segmentation?",
    "summary": "arXiv:2310.05341v5 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a model, initially trained on training data, to test data with potential distribution shifts. Most existing TTA methods focus on classification problems. The pronounced success of classification might lead numerous newcomers and engineers to assume that classic TTA techniques can be directly applied to the more challenging task of semantic segmentation. However, this belief is still an open question. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of existing classic TTA strategies in semantic segmentation. Our comprehensive results have led to three key observations. First, the classic normalization updating strategy only brings slight performance improvement, and in some cases, it might even adversely affect the results. Even with the application of advanced distribution estimation techniques like batch renormalization, the problem remains unresolved. Second, although the teacher-student scheme does enhance the training stability for segmentation TTA in the presence of noisy pseudo-labels and temporal correlation, it cannot directly result in performance improvement compared to the original model without TTA under complex data distribution. Third, segmentation TTA suffers a severe long-tailed class-imbalance problem, which is substantially more complex than that in TTA for classification. This long-tailed challenge negatively affects segmentation TTA performance, even when the accuracy of pseudo-labels is high. Besides those observations, we find that visual prompt tuning (VisPT) is promising in segmentation TTA and propose a novel method named TTAP. The outstanding performance of TTAP has also been verified. We hope the community can give more attention to this challenging, yet important, segmentation TTA task in the future.

In the literature, the generation quality of an unconditional method has been much worse than that of its conditional counterpart. This gap can be attributed to the lack of semantic information provided by labels. In this work, we show that one can close this gap by generating semantic representations in the representation space produced by a self-supervised encoder. These representations can be used to condition the image generator. This framework, called Representation-Conditioned Generation (RCG), provides an effective solution to the unconditional generation problem without using labels. Through comprehensive experiments, we observe that RCG significantly improves unconditional generation quality: e.g., it achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 2.15 on ImageNet 256x256, largely reducing the previous best of 5.91 by a relative 64%.

The attacker can embed hidden SSL backdoors via a few poisoned examples in the training dataset and maliciously manipulate the behavior of downstream models. To defend against SSL backdoor attacks, a feasible route is to detect and remove the poisonous samples in the training set. However, the existing SSL backdoor defense method fails to detect the poisonous samples precisely. In this paper, we propose to erase the SSL backdoor by cluster activation masking and propose a novel PoisonCAM method. After obtaining the threat model trained on the poisoned dataset, our method can precisely detect poisonous samples based on the assumption that masking the backdoor trigger can effectively change the activation of a downstream clustering model.

    "title": "RACCooN: A Versatile Instructional Video Editing Framework with Auto-Generated Narratives",
    "summary": "arXiv:2405.18406v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Recent video generative models primarily rely on carefully written text prompts for specific tasks, like inpainting or style editing. They require labor-intensive textual descriptions for input videos, hindering their flexibility to adapt personal/raw videos to user specifications. This paper proposes RACCooN, a versatile and user-friendly video-to-paragraph-to-video generative framework that supports multiple video editing capabilities such as removal, addition, and modification, through a unified pipeline. RACCooN consists of two principal stages: Video-to-Paragraph (V2P) and Paragraph-to-Video (P2V). In the V2P stage, we automatically describe video scenes in well-structured natural language, capturing both the holistic context and focused object details. Subsequently, in the P2V stage, users can optionally refine these descriptions to guide the video diffusion model, enabling various modifications to the input video, such as removing, changing subjects, and/or adding new objects. The proposed approach stands out from other methods through several significant contributions: (1) RACCooN suggests a multi-granular spatiotemporal pooling strategy to generate well-structured video descriptions, capturing both the broad context and object details without requiring complex human annotations, simplifying precise video content editing based on text for users. (2) Our video generative model incorporates auto-generated narratives or instructions to enhance the quality and accuracy of the generated content. (3) RACCooN also plans to imagine new objects in a given video, so users simply prompt the model to receive a detailed video editing plan for complex video editing. The proposed framework demonstrates impressive versatile capabilities in video-to-paragraph generation, video content editing, and can be incorporated into other SoTA video generative models for further enhancement.",

We introduce HENASY (Hierarchical ENtities ASsemblY), which includes a spatiotemporal token grouping mechanism to explicitly assemble dynamically evolving scene entities through time and model their relationship for video representation. By leveraging compositional structure understanding, HENASY possesses strong interpretability via visual grounding with free-form text queries. We further explore a suite of multi-grained contrastive losses to facilitate entity-centric understandings. This comprises three alignment types: video-narration, noun-entity, verb-entities alignments.\n  Our method demonstrates strong interpretability in both quantitative and qualitative experiments; while maintaining competitive performances on five downstream tasks via zero-shot transfer or as video/text representation, including video/text retrieval, action recognition, multi-choice query, natural language query, and moments query.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2406.08773v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: The denoising model has been proven a powerful generative model but has little exploration of discriminative tasks. Representation learning is important in discriminative tasks, which is defined as \"learning representations (or features) of the data that make it easier to extract useful information when building classifiers or other predictors\". In this paper, we propose a novel Denoising Model for Representation Learning (DenoiseRep) to improve feature discrimination with joint feature extraction and denoising. DenoiseRep views each embedding layer in a backbone as a denoising layer, processing the cascaded embedding layers as if we are recursively denoise features step-by-step. This unifies the frameworks of feature extraction and denoising, where the former progressively embeds features from low-level to high-level, and the latter recursively denoises features step-by-step. After that, DenoiseRep fuses the parameters of feature extraction and denoising layers, and theoretically demonstrates its equivalence before and after the fusion, thus making feature denoising computation-free. DenoiseRep is a label-free algorithm that incrementally improves features but also complementary to the label if available. Experimental results on various discriminative vision tasks, including re-identification (Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, MSMT17, CUHK-03, vehicleID), image classification (ImageNet, UB200, Oxford-Pet, Flowers), object detection (COCO), image segmentation (ADE20K) show stability and impressive improvements.

The core of LRM-Zero is our procedural 3D dataset, Zeroverse, which is automatically synthesized from simple primitive shapes with random texturing and augmentations (e.g., height fields, boolean differences, and wireframes). Unlike previous 3D datasets (e.g., Objaverse) which are often captured or crafted by humans to approximate real 3D data, Zeroverse completely ignores realistic global semantics but is rich in complex geometric and texture details that are locally similar to or even more intricate than real objects. We demonstrate that our LRM-Zero, trained with our fully synthesized Zeroverse, can achieve high visual quality in the reconstruction of real-world objects, competitive with models trained on Objaverse. We also analyze several critical design choices of Zeroverse that contribute to LRM-Zero's capability and training stability. Our work demonstrates that 3D reconstruction, one of the core tasks in 3D vision, can potentially be addressed without the semantics of real-world objects.

We observe that while a discrete-valued space can facilitate representing a categorical distribution, it is not a necessity for autoregressive modeling. In this work, we propose to model the per-token probability distribution using a diffusion procedure, which allows us to apply autoregressive models in a continuous-valued space. Rather than using categorical cross-entropy loss, we define a Diffusion Loss function to model the per-token probability. This approach eliminates the need for discrete-valued tokenizers. We evaluate its effectiveness across a wide range of cases, including standard autoregressive models and generalized masked autoregressive (MAR) variants. By removing vector quantization, our image generator achieves strong results while enjoying the speed advantage of sequence modeling. We hope this work will motivate the use of autoregressive generation in other continuous-valued domains and applications. Code is available at: https://github.com/LTH14/mar.",

While current benchmarks for object hallucination primarily concentrate on the presence of a single object class rather than individual entities, this work systematically investigates multi-object hallucination, examining how models misperceive (e.g., invent nonexistent objects or become distracted) when tasked with focusing on multiple objects simultaneously. We introduce Recognition-based Object Probing Evaluation (ROPE), an automated evaluation protocol that considers the distribution of object classes within a single image during testing and uses visual referring prompts to eliminate ambiguity. With comprehensive empirical studies and analysis of potential factors leading to multi-object hallucination, we found that (1). LVLMs suffer more hallucinations when focusing on multiple objects compared to a single object. (2). The tested object class distribution affects hallucination behaviors, indicating that LVLMs may follow shortcuts and spurious correlations. (3). Hallucinatory behaviors are influenced by data-specific factors, salience and frequency, and model intrinsic behaviors. We hope to enable LVLMs to recognize and reason about multiple objects that often occur in realistic visual scenes, provide insights, and quantify our progress towards mitigating the issues.",

However, these methods, primarily based on Retinex theory, tend to overlook the noise and color distortions in input images, leading to significant noise amplification and local color distortions in enhanced results. To address these issues, we propose the Dual-Path Error Compensation (DPEC) method, designed to improve image quality under low-light conditions by preserving local texture details while restoring global image brightness without amplifying noise. DPEC incorporates precise pixel-level error estimation to capture subtle differences and an independent denoising mechanism to prevent noise amplification. We introduce the HIS-Retinex loss to guide DPEC's training, ensuring the brightness distribution of enhanced images closely aligns with real-world conditions. To balance computational speed and resource efficiency while training DPEC for a comprehensive understanding of the global context, we integrated the VMamba architecture into its backbone. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in low-light image enhancement.

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\\% of annotated frames.

Existing work either crawls extra Internet data with a loose guarantee of quality or distills from black-box proprietary models, e.g., GPT-4V / Gemini that are API frequency and performance bounded. This work enables a VLM to improve itself via data enhancement, exploiting its generative nature. We introduce a simple yet effective VLM augmentation scheme that includes a self-augment step and a specialist-augment step to iteratively improve data quality and hence, model performance. In the self-augment step, the instruction-finetuned VLM recaptions its pretraining caption datasets and then retrains from scratch leveraging refined data. Without any expensive human-in-the-loop annotation, we observe improvements in data quality and downstream accuracy boosts with three self-augmentation rounds -- a viable free lunch to the current VLM training recipe. When self-augmentation saturates, we augment the caption diversity by leveraging specialty skills picked up from instruction finetuning. We finetune VLM specialists from the self-augmented VLM with domain-specific experts, including spatial, grounding, and OCR, to fuse task-aware synthetic data into the pretraining stage. Data quality improvements and hallucination reductions are cross-checked by VLM (GPT-4V, Gemini) and human judges.

Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution.

Image augmentation plays a crucial role in self-supervised learning, as it generates variations in image samples. However, traditional image augmentation techniques often overlook the unique characteristics of histopathological images. In this paper, we propose a new histopathology-specific image augmentation method called stain reconstruction augmentation (SRA). We integrate our SRA with MoCo v3, a leading model in self-supervised contrastive learning, along with our additional contrastive loss terms, and call the new model SRA-MoCo v3. We demonstrate that our SRA-MoCo v3 always outperforms the standard MoCo v3 across various downstream tasks and achieves comparable or superior performance to other foundation models pre-trained on significantly larger histopathology datasets.",

Spatial grounding with bounding boxes has gained attention for its simplicity and versatility, allowing for enhanced user control in image generation. However, prior training-free approaches often rely on updating the noisy image during the reverse diffusion process via backpropagation from custom loss functions, which frequently struggle to provide precise control over individual bounding boxes. In this work, we leverage the flexibility of the Transformer architecture, demonstrating that DiT can generate noisy patches corresponding to each bounding box, fully encoding the target object and allowing for fine-grained control over each region. Our approach builds on an intriguing property of DiT, which we refer to as semantic sharing. Due to semantic sharing, when a smaller patch is jointly denoised alongside a generatable-size image, the two become semantic clones. Each patch is denoised in its own branch of the generation process and then transplanted into the corresponding region of the original noisy image at each timestep, resulting in robust spatial grounding for each bounding box.

Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\\'on Caulle.

Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging and re-stratifying the train/test splits of ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring no overlap of patient data across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models in computer vision trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the vision transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the novel EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset.

This can dramatically reduce the computational time and increase the scalability. Then, we propose a novel feature-sensitive remeshing on the generated high-d embedding to automatically capture sharp geometric features.

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation.

Previous video generation models, however, primarily focus on slow learning by pre-training on vast amounts of data, overlooking the fast learning phase crucial for episodic memory storage. This oversight leads to inconsistencies across temporally distant frames when generating longer videos, as these frames fall beyond the model's context window. To this end, we introduce SlowFast-VGen, a novel dual-speed learning system for action-driven long video generation. Our approach incorporates a masked conditional video diffusion model for the slow learning of world dynamics, alongside an inference-time fast learning strategy based on a temporal LoRA module. Specifically, the fast learning process updates its temporal LoRA parameters based on local inputs and outputs, thereby efficiently storing episodic memory in its parameters. We further propose a slow-fast learning loop algorithm that seamlessly integrates the inner fast learning loop into the outer slow learning loop, enabling the recall of prior multi-episode experiences for context-aware skill learning. To facilitate the slow learning of an approximate world model, we collect a large-scale dataset of 200k videos with language action annotations, covering a wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments show that SlowFast-VGen outperforms baselines across various metrics for action-driven video generation, achieving an FVD score of 514 compared to 782, and maintaining consistency in longer videos, with an average of 0.37 scene cuts versus 0.89.

However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., $20\\sim 100$ samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts.

In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%.

While recent 3DGS methods have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis (NVS), accurately capturing high-fidelity geometry, physically interpretable materials and lighting remains challenging, as it requires precise geometry modeling to provide accurate surface normals, along with physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to ensure correct material and lighting disentanglement. Previous 3DGS methods resort to approximating surface normals, but often struggle with noisy local geometry, leading to inaccurate normal estimation and suboptimal material-lighting decomposition. In this paper, we introduce GeoSplatting, a novel hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with explicit geometric guidance and differentiable PBR equations. Specifically, we bridge isosurface and 3DGS together, where we first extract isosurface mesh from a scalar field, then convert it into 3DGS points and formulate PBR equations for them in a fully differentiable manner. In GeoSplatting, 3DGS is grounded on the mesh geometry, enabling precise surface normal modeling, which facilitates the use of PBR frameworks for material decomposition. This approach further maintains the efficiency and quality of NVS from 3DGS while ensuring accurate geometry from the isosurface.

Our approach combines the reliability of classical probabilistic algorithms with the performance and efficiency of modern neural networks. Although robotic perception is often divided between modern differentiable methods and classical explicit methods, a union of both is necessary for real-time and trustworthy performance. We introduce a novel Convolutional Bayesian Kernel Inference (ConvBKI) layer which incorporates semantic segmentation predictions online into a 3D map through a depthwise convolution layer by leveraging conjugate priors. We compare ConvBKI against state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and probabilistic algorithms for mapping to evaluate reliability and performance. We also create a Robot Operating System (ROS) package of ConvBKI and test it on real-world perceptually challenging off-road driving data.",

Despite its innovative approach to seamless display integration, UDC technology faces unique image degradation challenges exacerbated by the susceptibility to adversarial perturbations. Our research initially conducts an in-depth robustness evaluation of deep-learning-based UDC image restoration models by employing several white-box and black-box attacking methods. This evaluation is pivotal in understanding the vulnerabilities of current UDC image restoration techniques. Following the assessment, we introduce a defense framework integrating adversarial purification with subsequent fine-tuning processes. First, our approach employs diffusion-based adversarial purification, effectively neutralizing adversarial perturbations. Then, we apply the fine-tuning methodologies to refine the image restoration models further, ensuring that the quality and fidelity of the restored images are maintained.

To address this issue, we introduce SMART, a novel autonomous driving motion generation paradigm that models vectorized map and agent trajectory data into discrete sequence tokens. These tokens are then processed through a decoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction task across spatial-temporal series. This GPT-style method allows the model to learn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios. SMART achieves state-of-the-art performance across most of the metrics on the generative Sim Agents challenge, ranking 1st on the leaderboards of Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), demonstrating remarkable inference speed. Moreover, SMART represents the generative model in the autonomous driving motion domain, exhibiting zero-shot generalization capabilities: Using only the NuPlan dataset for training and WOMD for validation, SMART achieved a competitive score of 0.72 on the Sim Agents challenge. Lastly, we have collected over 1 billion motion tokens from multiple datasets, validating the model's scalability. These results suggest that SMART has initially emulated two important properties: scalability and zero-shot generalization, and preliminarily meets the needs of large-scale real-time simulation applications.

Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE.

This dot-product self-attention computes attention weights among the input tokens using Euclidean distance, which makes the model prone to representation collapse and vulnerable to contaminated samples. In this paper, we propose using a Mahalanobis distance metric for computing the attention weights to stretch the underlying feature space in directions of high contextual relevance. In particular, we define a hyper-ellipsoidal neighborhood around each query to increase the attention weights of the tokens lying in the contextually important directions. We term this novel class of attention Elliptical Attention. Our Elliptical Attention provides two benefits: 1) reducing representation collapse and 2) enhancing the model's robustness as Elliptical Attention pays more attention to contextually relevant information rather than focusing on some small subset of informative features. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of Elliptical Attention over the baseline dot-product attention and state-of-the-art attention methods on various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling across different data modalities.",

While detecting such cases may be critical, evaluating a model's vulnerability at a per-instance level using adversarial attacks is computationally too intensive and unsuitable for real-time deployment scenarios. The input space margin is the exact score to detect non-robust samples and is intractable for deep neural networks. This paper introduces the concept of margin consistency -- a property that links the input space margins and the logit margins in robust models -- for efficient detection of vulnerable samples. First, we establish that margin consistency is a necessary and sufficient condition to use a model's logit margin as a score for identifying non-robust samples. Next, through comprehensive empirical analysis of various robustly trained models on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets, we show that they indicate high margin consistency with a strong correlation between their input space margins and the logit margins. Then, we show that we can effectively and confidently use the logit margin to detect brittle decisions with such models. Finally, we address cases where the model is not sufficiently margin-consistent by learning a pseudo-margin from the feature representation. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging deep representations to assess adversarial vulnerability in deployment scenarios efficiently.",

Existing methods discover error slices by clustering the error-prone samples with similar patterns or assigning discrete attributes to each sample for post-hoc analysis. While these methods aim for interpretability and easier mitigation through reweighting or rebalancing, they may not capture the full complexity of error patterns due to incomplete or missing attributes. Contrary to the existing approach, this paper utilizes the reasoning capabilities of the Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze complex error patterns and generate testable hypotheses. This paper proposes LADDER: Language Driven slice Discovery and Error Rectification. It first projects the model's representation into a language-aligned feature space (eg CLIP) to preserve semantics in the original model feature space. This ensures the accurate retrieval of sentences that highlight the model's errors. Next, the LLM utilizes the sentences and generates hypotheses to discover error slices. Finally, we mitigate the error by fine-tuning the classification head by creating a group-balanced dataset using the hypotheses.

VascX models demonstrated superior segmentation performance across datasets, image quality levels, and anatomic regions when compared to existing, publicly available models, likely due to the increased size and variety of our training set. Important improvements were observed in artery-vein and disc segmentation performance, particularly in segmentations of these structures on CFIs of intermediate quality, common in large cohorts and clinical datasets. Importantly, these improvements translated into significantly more accurate vascular features when we compared features extracted from VascX segmentation masks with features extracted from segmentation masks generated by previous models. With VascX models we provide a robust, ready-to-use set of model ensembles and inference code aimed at simplifying the implementation and enhancing the quality of automated retinal vasculature analyses.

Current research in large-scale neuro-behavioral data analysis often relies on decoding models, which quantify behavioral information in neural data but lack details on behavior encoding. This raises an intriguing scientific question: ``how can we enable in-depth exploration of neural representations in behavioral tasks, revealing interpretable neural dynamics associated with behaviors''. However, addressing this issue is challenging due to the varied behavioral encoding across different brain regions and mixed selectivity at the population level. To tackle this limitation, our approach, named ``BeNeDiff'', first identifies a fine-grained and disentangled neural subspace using a behavior-informed latent variable model. It then employs state-of-the-art generative diffusion models to synthesize behavior videos that interpret the neural dynamics of each latent factor. We validate the method on multi-session datasets containing widefield calcium imaging recordings across the dorsal cortex. Through guiding the diffusion model to activate individual latent factors, we verify that the neural dynamics of latent factors in the disentangled neural subspace provide interpretable quantifications of the behaviors of interest. At the same time, the neural subspace in BeNeDiff demonstrates high disentanglement and neural reconstruction quality.",

While previous research has shown promise, there are still limitations. Methods based on VAEs are accompanied by issues of local jitter and global instability, whereas methods based on diffusion models are hampered by low generation efficiency. This is because the denoising process of DDPM in the latter relies on the assumption that the noise added at each step is sampled from a unimodal distribution, and the noise values are small. DDIM borrows the idea from the Euler method for solving differential equations, disrupts the Markov chain process, and increases the noise step size to reduce the number of denoising steps, thereby accelerating generation. However, simply increasing the step size during the step-by-step denoising process causes the results to gradually deviate from the original data distribution, leading to a significant drop in the quality of the generated actions and the emergence of unnatural artifacts. In this paper, we break the assumptions of DDPM and achieves breakthrough progress in denoising speed and fidelity. Specifically, we introduce a conditional GAN to capture audio control signals and implicitly match the multimodal denoising distribution between the diffusion and denoising steps within the same sampling step, aiming to sample larger noise values and apply fewer denoising steps for high-speed generation.",

By dynamically adjusting the contribution of each client during model aggregation, our method accounts for domain-specific differences and improves generalization across heterogeneous datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances segmentation accuracy and reduces the impact of domain shift compared to conventional FL methods while maintaining privacy-preserving capabilities.

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape &amp; trend, velocity &amp; frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence.

In contrast, our approach uses diffusion models with only a reconstruction loss, eliminating the need for facial landmarks or masks while still producing images with intricate, fine-grained details. We validated our results on two public benchmarks through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in three key areas: identity anonymization, facial attribute preservation, and image quality. Beyond its primary function of anonymization, our model can also perform face swapping tasks by incorporating an additional facial image as input, demonstrating its versatility and potential for diverse applications.

    "title": "Zipfian Whitening",
    "summary": "The word embedding space in neural models is skewed, and correcting this can improve task performance. We point out that most approaches for modeling, correcting, and measuring the symmetry of an embedding space implicitly assume that the word frequencies are uniform; in reality, word frequencies follow a highly non-uniform distribution, known as Zipf's law. Surprisingly, simply performing PCA whitening weighted by the empirical word frequency that follows Zipf's law significantly improves task performance, surpassing established baselines. From a theoretical perspective, both our approach and existing methods can be clearly categorized: word representations are distributed according to an exponential family with either uniform or Zipfian base measures. By adopting the latter approach, we can naturally emphasize informative low-frequency words in terms of their vector norm, which becomes evident from the information-geometric perspective, and in terms of the loss functions for imbalanced classification. Additionally, our theory corroborates that popular natural language processing methods, such as skip-gram negative sampling, WhiteningBERT, and headless language models, work well just because their word embeddings encode the empirical word frequency into the underlying probabilistic model.",

    "title": "Constant Acceleration Flow",
    "summary": "Rectified flow and reflow procedures have significantly advanced fast generation by progressively straightening ordinary differential equation (ODE) flows. They operate under the assumption that image and noise pairs, known as couplings, can be approximated by straight trajectories with constant velocity. However, we observe that modeling with constant velocity and using reflow procedures have limitations in accurately learning straight trajectories between pairs, resulting in suboptimal performance in few-step generation. To address these limitations, we introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), a novel framework based on a simple constant acceleration equation. CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, allowing for more expressive and accurate estimation of the ODE flow. Moreover, we propose two techniques to further improve estimation accuracy: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity. Our comprehensive studies on toy datasets, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet 64x64 demonstrate that CAF outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for one-step generation. We also show that CAF dramatically improves few-step coupling preservation and inversion over Rectified flow. Code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF{https://github.com/mlvlab/CAF}.",

    "summary": "Existing efforts in building GUI agents heavily rely on the availability of robust commercial Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and GeminiProVision. Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.",

We evaluate our model on the NASA battery discharge dataset and show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on this dataset. We further introduce a novel anchor-based resampling method which ensures time signals are of the expected length while also serving as augmentation technique. Finally, we condition prediction on the sample time and the cycle time difference using positional encodings to improve the performance of our model and to learn recuperation effects. Our results proof that our model is able to predict the SOH of Li-ion batteries with high accuracy and robustness.",

We focus primarily on user-guided interactions, surveying interactions that are initiated by the user and do not include any implicit signals given by the user.

However, the impact of the inherent reasoning structures on LLM M-QA performance remains unclear, largely due to the absence of QA datasets that provide fine-grained reasoning structures. To address this gap, we introduce the Graph Reasoning-Structured Question Answering Dataset (GRS-QA), which includes both semantic contexts and reasoning structures for QA pairs. Unlike existing M-QA datasets, where different reasoning structures are entangled together, GRS-QA explicitly captures intricate reasoning pathways by constructing reasoning graphs, where nodes represent textual contexts and edges denote logical flows. These reasoning graphs of different structures enable a fine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning capabilities across various reasoning structures. Our empirical analysis reveals that LLMs perform differently when handling questions with varying reasoning structures. This finding facilitates the exploration of textual structures as compared with semantics.",

Despite the importance and recent progress, most existing works on personalized LLMs have focused either entirely on (a) personalized text generation or (b) leveraging LLMs for personalization-related downstream applications, such as recommendation systems. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two separate main directions for the first time by introducing a taxonomy for personalized LLM usage and summarizing the key differences and challenges. We provide a formalization of the foundations of personalized LLMs that consolidates and expands notions of personalization of LLMs, defining and discussing novel facets of personalization, usage, and desiderata of personalized LLMs. We then unify the literature across these diverse fields and usage scenarios by proposing systematic taxonomies for the granularity of personalization, personalization techniques, datasets, evaluation methods, and applications of personalized LLMs. Finally, we highlight challenges and important open problems that remain to be addressed. By unifying and surveying recent research using the proposed taxonomies, we aim to provide a clear guide to the existing literature and different facets of personalization in LLMs, empowering both researchers and practitioners.",

Besides, the existing benchmarks usually report overall average scores of different languages, where the fine-grained abilities in different completion scenarios are ignored. Therefore, to facilitate the research of code LLMs in multilingual scenarios, we propose a massively multilingual repository-level code completion benchmark covering 18 programming languages (called M2RC-EVAL), and two types of fine-grained annotations (i.e., bucket-level and semantic-level) on different completion scenarios are provided, where we obtain these annotations based on the parsed abstract syntax tree. Moreover, we also curate a massively multilingual instruction corpora M2RC- INSTRUCT dataset to improve the repository-level code completion abilities of existing code LLMs. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our M2RC-EVAL and M2RC-INSTRUCT.",

    "summary": "This paper presents Randomized AutoRegressive modeling (RAR) for visual generation, which sets a new state-of-the-art performance on the image generation task while maintaining full compatibility with language modeling frameworks. The proposed RAR is simple: during a standard autoregressive training process with a next-token prediction objective, the input sequence-typically ordered in raster form-is randomly permuted into different factorization orders with a probability r, where r starts at 1 and linearly decays to 0 over the course of training. This annealing training strategy enables the model to learn to maximize the expected likelihood over all factorization orders and thus effectively improve the model's capability of modeling bidirectional contexts. Importantly, RAR preserves the integrity of the autoregressive modeling framework, ensuring full compatibility with language modeling while significantly improving performance in image generation. On the ImageNet-256 benchmark, RAR achieves an FID score of 1.48, not only surpassing prior state-of-the-art autoregressive image generators but also outperforming leading diffusion-based and masked transformer-based methods.

    "summary": "Recent research arXiv:2410.15027 has explored the use of diffusion transformers (DiTs) for task-agnostic image generation by simply concatenating attention tokens across images. However, despite substantial computational resources, the fidelity of the generated images remains suboptimal. In this study, we reevaluate and streamline this framework by hypothesizing that text-to-image DiTs inherently possess in-context generation capabilities, requiring only minimal tuning to activate them. Through diverse task experiments, we qualitatively demonstrate that existing text-to-image DiTs can effectively perform in-context generation without any tuning. Building on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple pipeline to leverage the in-context abilities of DiTs: (1) concatenate images instead of tokens, (2) perform joint captioning of multiple images, and (3) apply task-specific LoRA tuning using small datasets (e.g., 20sim 100 samples) instead of full-parameter tuning with large datasets. We name our models In-Context LoRA (IC-LoRA). This approach requires no modifications to the original DiT models, only changes to the training data. Remarkably, our pipeline generates high-fidelity image sets that better adhere to prompts. While task-specific in terms of tuning data, our framework remains task-agnostic in architecture and pipeline, offering a powerful tool for the community and providing valuable insights for further research on product-level task-agnostic generation systems.

While integrating LLMs with tools can increase reliability, this approach typically results in over-reliance on tools, diminishing the model's ability to solve simple problems through basic reasoning. In contrast, human experts first assess problem complexity using domain knowledge before choosing an appropriate solution approach. Inspired by this human problem-solving process, we propose a novel two-component fine-tuning method. In the first component World Knowledge Distillation (WKD), LLMs learn directly from solutions generated using tool's information to internalize domain knowledge. In the second component Tool Usage Adaptation (TUA), we partition problems into easy and hard categories based on the model's direct answering accuracy. While maintaining the same alignment target for easy problems as in WKD, we train the model to intelligently switch to tool usage for more challenging problems. We validate our method on six scientific benchmark datasets, spanning mathematics, climate science and epidemiology. On average, our models demonstrate a 28.18% improvement in answer accuracy and a 13.89% increase in tool usage precision across all datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art models including GPT-4o and Claude-3.5.",
