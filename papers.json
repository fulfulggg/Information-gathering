    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05822v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In this paper, we propose SPACE, a novel anomaly detection methodology that integrates a Feature Encoder (FE) into the structure of the Student-Teacher method. The proposed method has two key elements: Spatial Consistency regularization Loss (SCL) and Feature converter Module (FM). SCL prevents overfitting in student models by avoiding excessive imitation of the teacher model. Simultaneously, it facilitates the expansion of normal data features by steering clear of abnormal areas generated through data augmentation. This dual functionality ensures a robust boundary between normal and abnormal data. The FM prevents the learning of ambiguous information from the FE. This protects the learned features and enables more effective detection of structural and logical anomalies. Through these elements, SPACE is available to minimize the influence of the FE while integrating various data augmentations.In this study, we evaluated the proposed method on the MVTec LOCO, MVTec AD, and VisA datasets. Experimental results, through qualitative evaluation, demonstrate the superiority of detection and efficiency of each module compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05823v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recently, there is a growing interest in creating computer-aided design (CAD) models based on user intent, known as controllable CAD generation. Existing work offers limited controllability and needs separate models for different types of control, reducing efficiency and practicality. To achieve controllable generation across all CAD construction hierarchies, such as sketch-extrusion, extrusion, sketch, face, loop and curve, we propose FlexCAD, a unified model by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). First, to enhance comprehension by LLMs, we represent a CAD model as a structured text by abstracting each hierarchy as a sequence of text tokens. Second, to address various controllable generation tasks in a unified model, we introduce a hierarchy-aware masking strategy. Specifically, during training, we mask a hierarchy-aware field in the CAD text with a mask token. This field, composed of a sequence of tokens, can be set flexibly to represent various hierarchies. Subsequently, we ask LLMs to predict this masked field. During inference, the user intent is converted into a CAD text with a mask token replacing the part the user wants to modify, which is then fed into FlexCAD to generate new CAD models. Comprehensive experiments on public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FlexCAD in both generation quality and controllability.

For the latter, stabilization must work automatically for the general population with people of varying morphology. Distinguishing rigid skull motion from facial expressions is critical since misalignment between skull motion and facial expressions can lead to animation models that are hard to control and can not fit natural motion. Existing methods struggle to work with sparse sets of very different expressions, such as when combining multiple units from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Certain approaches are not robust enough, some depend on motion data to find stable points, while others make one-for-all invalid physiological assumptions. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in neural signed distance fields and differentiable isosurface meshing to compute skull stabilization rigid transforms directly on unstructured triangle meshes or point clouds, significantly enhancing accuracy and robustness. We introduce the concept of a stable hull as the surface of the boolean intersection of stabilized scans, analogous to the visual hull in shape-from-silhouette and the photo hull from space carving. This hull resembles a skull overlaid with minimal soft tissue thickness, upper teeth are automatically included. Our skull carving algorithm simultaneously optimizes the stable hull shape and rigid transforms to get accurate stabilization of complex expressions for large diverse sets of people, outperforming existing methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05832v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Designing a fast and effective entropy model is challenging but essential for practical application of neural codecs. Beyond spatial autoregressive entropy models, more efficient backward adaptation-based entropy models have been recently developed. They not only reduce decoding time by using smaller number of modeling steps but also maintain or even improve rate--distortion performance by leveraging more diverse contexts for backward adaptation. Despite their significant progress, we argue that their performance has been limited by the simple adoption of the design convention for forward adaptation: using only a single type of hyper latent representation, which does not provide sufficient contextual information, especially in the first modeling step. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective entropy modeling framework that leverages sufficient contexts for forward adaptation without compromising on bit-rate. Specifically, we introduce a strategy of diversifying hyper latent representations for forward adaptation, i.e., using two additional types of contexts along with the existing single type of context. In addition, we present a method to effectively use the diverse contexts for contextualizing the current elements to be encoded/decoded. By addressing the limitation of the previous approach, our proposed framework leads to significant performance improvements. Experimental results on popular datasets show that our proposed framework consistently improves rate--distortion performance across various bit-rate regions, e.g., 3.73% BD-rate gain over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Kodak dataset.",

Standard gradient-based maps are frequently observed to be highly sensitive to the randomness of training data and the stochasticity in the training process. In this work, we study the role of randomized smoothing in the well-known Smooth-Grad algorithm in the stability of the gradient-based maps to the randomness of training samples. We extend the algorithmic stability framework to gradient-based saliency maps and prove bounds on the stability error of standard Simple-Grad, Integrated-Gradients, and Smooth-Grad saliency maps. Our theoretical results suggest the role of Gaussian smoothing in boosting the stability of gradient-based maps to the randomness of training settings. On the other hand, we analyze the faithfulness of the Smooth-Grad maps to the original Simple-Grad and show the lower fidelity under a more intense Gaussian smoothing. We support our theoretical results by performing several numerical experiments on standard image datasets. Our empirical results confirm our hypothesis on the fidelity-stability trade-off in the application of Gaussian smoothing to gradient-based interpretation maps.",

The development of deep learning has led to significant advances in this field. However, existing methods often struggle to balance image quality, embedding capacity, and security. This paper proposes a novel approach to image steganography by enhancing an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms, specifically focusing on channel and spatial attention modules. We systematically investigate five configurations: (1) channel attention, (2) spatial attention, (3) sequential channel followed by spatial attention, (4) spatial attention followed by channel attention and (5) parallel channel and spatial attention. Our experiments show that adding attention mechanisms improves the ability to embed hidden information while maintaining the visual quality of the images. The increase in the PSNR and SSIM scores shows that using a parallel combination of channel and spatial attention improves image quality and hiding capacity simultaneously. This is in contrast to previous works where there is a tradeoff between them. This study shows that attention mechanisms in image steganography lead to better hiding of secret information.

While prior research has focused on enhancing final outcomes, the opaque nature of the decision-making process in these models remains a concern for experts. Additionally, the deployment of these methods can be problematic in resource-limited environments. This paper tackles the inherent black-box nature of these models by providing real-time explanations during the training phase, compelling the model to concentrate on the most distinctive and crucial aspects of the input. Furthermore, we employ established quantization techniques to address resource constraints. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we explore how quantization influences the interpretability and accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks through a comparative analysis of saliency maps from standard and quantized models. Quantization is implemented during the training phase using the Parameterized Clipping Activation method, with a focus on the MNIST and FashionMNIST benchmark datasets. We evaluated three bit-width configurations (2-bit, 4-bit, and mixed 4/2-bit) to explore the trade-off between efficiency and interpretability, with each configuration designed to highlight varying impacts on saliency map clarity and model accuracy. The results indicate that while quantization is crucial for implementing models on resource-limited devices, it necessitates a trade-off between accuracy and interpretability. Lower bit-widths result in more pronounced reductions in both metrics, highlighting the necessity of meticulous quantization parameter selection in applications where model transparency is paramount. The study underscores the importance of achieving a balance between efficiency and interpretability in the deployment of neural networks.",

This task presents two principal challenges: (1) severe inconsistencies in feature representation across different remote sensing domains, and (2) a domain gap that emerges due to the representation bias of source domain patterns when translating features to predictive logits. To tackle these issues, we propose a joint-optimized adversarial network incorporating the \"Segment Anything Model (SAM) (SAM-JOANet)\" for UDA-RSSeg. Our approach integrates SAM to leverage its robust generalized representation capabilities, thereby alleviating feature inconsistencies. We introduce a finetuning decoder designed to convert SAM-Encoder features into predictive logits. Additionally, a feature-level adversarial-based prompted segmentor is employed to generate class-agnostic maps, which guide the finetuning decoder's feature representations. The network is optimized end-to-end, combining the prompted segmentor and the finetuning decoder.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05879v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of identifying human emotions from given data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because facial expressions contain rich emotional cues. However, it is important to note that facial expressions may not always precisely reflect genuine emotions and FER-based results may yield misleading ER. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cues for the creation of a new Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. Different from existing multimodal ER datasets, the EMER dataset employs a stimulus material-induced spontaneous emotion generation method to integrate non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movements and eye fixation maps, with facial videos, aiming to obtain natural and accurate human emotions. Notably, for the first time, we provide annotations for both ER and FER in the EMER, enabling a comprehensive analysis to better illustrate the gap between both tasks. Furthermore, we specifically design a new EMERT architecture to concurrently enhance performance in both ER and FER by efficiently identifying and bridging the emotion gap between the two.Specifically, our EMERT employs modality-adversarial feature decoupling and multi-task Transformer to augment the modeling of eye behaviors, thus providing an effective complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.",

In this work we present Moving Off-the-Grid (MooG), a self-supervised video representation model that offers an alternative approach, allowing tokens to move \"off-the-grid\" to better enable them to represent scene elements consistently, even as they move across the image plane through time. By using a combination of cross-attention and positional embeddings we disentangle the representation structure and image structure. We find that a simple self-supervised objective--next frame prediction--trained on video data, results in a set of latent tokens which bind to specific scene structures and track them as they move. We demonstrate the usefulness of MooG's learned representation both qualitatively and quantitatively by training readouts on top of the learned representation on a variety of downstream tasks. We show that MooG can provide a strong foundation for different vision tasks when compared to \"on-the-grid\" baselines.",

This study focuses on image classification tasks, comparing AL methods on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Food101, and the Chest X-ray datasets under varying label noise rates. We investigate the impact of model architecture by comparing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformer (ViT)-based models. Additionally, we propose a novel deep active learning algorithm, GCI-ViTAL, designed to be robust to label noise. GCI-ViTAL utilizes prediction entropy and the Frobenius norm of last-layer attention vectors compared to class-centric clean set attention vectors. Our method identifies samples that are both uncertain and semantically divergent from typical images in their assigned class. This allows GCI-ViTAL to select informative data points even in the presence of label noise while flagging potentially mislabeled candidates. Label smoothing is applied to train a model that is not overly confident about potentially noisy labels. We evaluate GCI-ViTAL under varying levels of symmetric label noise and compare it to five other AL strategies. Our results demonstrate that using ViTs leads to significant performance improvements over CNNs across all AL strategies, particularly in noisy label settings. We also find that using the semantic information of images as label grounding helps in training a more robust model under label noise. Notably, we do not perform extensive hyperparameter tuning, providing an out-of-the-box comparison that addresses the common challenge practitioners face in selecting models and active learning strategies without an exhaustive literature review on training and fine-tuning vision models on real-world application data.",

However, this cloud-only approach underutilizes edge computational resources and requires significant bandwidth for transmitting raw images. In this paper, we introduce an edge-cloud collaborative VQA system, called LLaVA-AlignedVQ, which features a novel Aligned Vector Quantization algorithm (AlignedVQ) that efficiently compress intermediate features without compromising accuracy to support partitioned execution. Our experiments demonstrate that LLaVA-AlignedVQ achieves approximately 1365x compression rate of intermediate features, reducing data transmission overhead by 96.8% compared to transmitting JPEG90-compressed images to the cloud. LLaVA-AlignedVQ achieves an inference speedup of 2-15x while maintaining high accuracy, remaining within -2.23% to +1.6% of the original model's accuracy performance across eight VQA datasets, compared to the cloud-only solution.",

The Digital Twin technology allows for the creation of a virtual model of the space, facilitating the simulation, training, and testing of cleanliness management strategies before implementation in the real world. In this paper, we present the utilisation of advanced vision surveillance systems and the Digital Twin technology in cleanliness management, using a railway station as an example. The Digital Twin was created based on an actual 3D model in the Nvidia Omniverse Isaac Sim simulator. A litter detector, bin occupancy level detector, stain segmentation, and a human detector (including the cleaning crew) along with their movement analysis were implemented.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05993v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been recently utilized to deal with various blind image restoration (IR) tasks, where they have demonstrated outstanding performance in terms of perceptual quality. However, the task-specific nature of existing solutions and the excessive computational costs related to their training, make such models impractical and challenging to use for different IR tasks than those that were initially trained for. This hinders their wider adoption, especially by those who lack access to powerful computational resources and vast amount of training data. In this work we aim to address the above issues and enable the successful adoption of DPMs in practical IR-related applications. Towards this goal, we propose a modular diffusion probabilistic IR framework (DP-IR), which allows us to combine the performance benefits of existing pre-trained state-of-the-art IR networks and generative DPMs, while it requires only the additional training of a relatively small module (0.7M params) related to the particular IR task of interest. Moreover, the architecture of the proposed framework allows for a sampling strategy that leads to at least four times reduction of neural function evaluations without suffering any performance loss, while it can also be combined with existing acceleration techniques such as DDIM. We evaluate our model on four benchmarks for the tasks of burst JDD-SR, dynamic scene deblurring, and super-resolution. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of perceptual quality while it retains a competitive performance with respect to fidelity metrics.",

To address this challenge, we introduce GaussianSpa, an optimization-based simplification framework for compact and high-quality 3DGS. Specifically, we formulate the simplification as an optimization problem associated with the 3DGS training. Correspondingly, we propose an efficient \"optimizing-sparsifying\" solution that alternately solves two independent sub-problems, gradually imposing strong sparsity onto the Gaussians in the training process. Our comprehensive evaluations on various datasets show the superiority of GaussianSpa over existing state-of-the-art approaches.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06023v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Lifelong person re-identification attempts to recognize people across cameras and integrate new knowledge from continuous data streams. Key challenges involve addressing catastrophic forgetting caused by parameter updating and domain shift, and maintaining performance in seen and unseen domains. Many previous works rely on data memories to retain prior samples. However, the amount of retained data increases linearly with the number of training domains, leading to continually increasing memory consumption. Additionally, these methods may suffer significant performance degradation when data preservation is prohibited due to privacy concerns. To address these limitations, we propose using textual descriptions as guidance to encourage the ReID model to learn cross-domain invariant features without retaining samples. The key insight is that natural language can describe pedestrian instances with an invariant style, suggesting a shared textual space for any pedestrian images. By leveraging this shared textual space as an anchor, we can prompt the ReID model to embed images from various domains into a unified semantic space, thereby alleviating catastrophic forgetting caused by domain shifts. To achieve this, we introduce a task-driven dynamic textual prompt framework in this paper. This model features a dynamic prompt fusion module, which adaptively constructs and fuses two different textual prompts as anchors. This effectively guides the ReID model to embed images into a unified semantic space. Additionally, we design a text-visual feature alignment module to learn a more precise mapping between fine-grained visual and textual features. We also developed a learnable knowledge distillation module that allows our model to dynamically balance retaining existing knowledge with acquiring new knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms SOTAs under various settings.",

Specifically, the proposed framework, abbreviated as PointCG, consists of a Hidden Point Completion (HPC) module and an Arbitrary-view Image Generation (AIG) module. We first capture visible points from arbitrary views as inputs by removing hidden points. Then, HPC extracts representations of the inputs with an encoder and completes the entire shape with a decoder, while AIG is used to generate rendered images based on the visible points' representations.

In this paper, we construct a novel VQA dataset, Spatial-MM, to comprehensively study LMMs' spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities. Our analyses on object-relationship and multi-hop reasoning reveal several important findings. Firstly, bounding boxes and scene graphs, even synthetic ones, can significantly enhance LMMs' spatial reasoning. Secondly, LMMs struggle more with questions posed from the human perspective than the camera perspective about the image. Thirdly, chain of thought (CoT) prompting does not improve model performance on complex multi-hop questions involving spatial relations. % Moreover, spatial reasoning steps are much less accurate than non-spatial ones across MLLMs. Lastly, our perturbation analysis on GQA-spatial reveals that LMMs are much stronger at basic object detection than complex spatial reasoning.

Although recently pretrained vision-language models demonstrate strong zero-shot performance across various visual tasks, they focus on learning class semantics, which makes their direct application to ZSAD challenging. To address this scenario, we propose GlocalCLIP, which uniquely separates global and local prompts and jointly optimizes them. This approach enables the object-agnostic glocal semantic prompt design to effectively capture general normal and anomalous patterns without dependency on specific objects in the image. We refine the text prompts for more precise adjustments by utilizing deep-text prompt tuning in the text encoder. In the vision encoder, we apply V-V attention layers to capture detailed local image features. Finally, we introduce glocal contrastive learning to improve the complementary learning of global and local prompts, effectively detecting abnormal patterns across various domains. The generalization performance of GlocalCLIP in ZSAD was demonstrated on 15 real-world datasets from both the industrial and medical domains, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.",

In this paper, we present Aquila, an advanced visual language foundation model designed to enable richer visual feature representation and more precise visual-language feature alignment for remote sensing images. Our approach introduces a learnable Hierarchical Spatial Feature Integration (SFI) module that supports high resolution image inputs and aggregates multi scale visual features, allowing for the detailed representation of complex visual information.

However, most remote sensing images predominantly consist of scenographic scenes containing multiple ground objects without explicit foreground targets, which limits the performance of existing SSL methods that focus on foreground targets. This raises the question: Is there a method that can automatically aggregate similar objects within scenographic remote sensing images, thereby enabling models to differentiate knowledge embedded in various geospatial patterns for improved feature representation? In this work, we present the Pattern Integration and Enhancement Vision Transformer (PIEViT), a novel self-supervised learning framework designed specifically for remote sensing imagery.

It employs the Geospatial Pattern Cohesion (GPC) module to explore the natural clustering of patches, enhancing the differentiation of individual features. The Feature Integration Projection (FIP) module further refines masked token reconstruction using geospatially clustered patches. We validated PIEViT across multiple downstream tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection.

In this paper, we attempt to mitigate long-tailed issues through architectural improvements. To simplify the design process, we utilize Differential Architecture Search (DARTS) to achieve this goal. Unfortunately, existing DARTS methods struggle to perform well in long-tailed scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Long-Tailed Differential Architecture Search (LT-DARTS). Specifically, we conduct extensive experiments to explore architectural components that demonstrate better performance on long-tailed data and propose a new search space based on our observations. This ensures that the architecture obtained through our search process incorporates superior components. Additionally, we propose replacing the learnable linear classifier with an Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to further enhance our method.

The BEV representation formulated by the frustum based on depth distribution prediction is ideal for learning the road structure and scene layout from multi-view images. However, to retain computational efficiency, the compressed BEV representation such as in resolution and axis is inevitably weak in retaining the individual geometric details, undermining the methodological generality and applicability. With this in mind, to compensate for the missing details and utilize multi-view geometry constraints, we propose LSSInst, a two-stage object detector incorporating BEV and instance representations in tandem. The proposed detector exploits fine-grained pixel-level features that can be flexibly integrated into existing LSS-based BEV networks. Having said that, due to the inherent gap between two representation spaces, we design the instance adaptor for the BEV-to-instance semantic coherence rather than pass the proposal naively.

However, non-square aspect ratios of image or video inputs can negatively impact re-identification accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel, human perception driven, and general ViT-based ReID framework that fuses models trained on various aspect ratios. Our key contributions are threefold: (i) We analyze the impact of aspect ratios on performance using the VeRi-776 and VehicleID datasets, providing guidance for input settings based on the distribution of original image aspect ratios. (ii) We introduce patch-wise mixup strategy during ViT patchification (guided by spatial attention scores) and implement uneven stride for better alignment with object aspect ratios. (iii) We propose a dynamic feature fusion ReID network to enhance model robustness. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art transformer-based approaches on both datasets, with only a minimal increase in inference time per image.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06315v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Medical brain imaging relies heavily on image registration to accurately curate structural boundaries of brain features for various healthcare applications. Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in image registration in recent years. Still, they often struggle to handle the diversity of 3D brain volumes, challenged by their structural and contrastive variations and their imaging domains. In this work, we present NeuReg, a Neuro-inspired 3D image registration architecture with the feature of domain invariance. NeuReg generates domain-agnostic representations of imaging features and incorporates a shifting window-based Swin Transformer block as the encoder. This enables our model to capture the variations across brain imaging modalities and species. We demonstrate a new benchmark in multi-domain publicly available datasets comprising human and mouse 3D brain volumes. Extensive experiments reveal that our model (NeuReg) outperforms the existing baseline deep learning-based image registration models and provides a high-performance boost on cross-domain datasets, where models are trained on 'source-only' domain and tested on completely 'unseen' target domains. Our work establishes a new state-of-the-art for domain-agnostic 3D brain image registration, underpinned by Neuro-inspired Transformer-based architecture.",

Existing models struggle in this regard due to the slow growth of receptive field for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) based methods and patch-level interactions in Transformer-based methods, which are ineffective for capturing long-range dependencies.\n  Motivated by this, we propose SEM-Net, a novel visual State Space model (SSM) vision network, modelling corrupted images at the pixel level while capturing long-range dependencies (LRDs) in state space, achieving a linear computational complexity. To address the inherent lack of spatial awareness in SSM, we introduce the Snake Mamba Block (SMB) and Spatially-Enhanced Feedforward Network. These innovations enable SEM-Net to outperform state-of-the-art inpainting methods on two distinct datasets, showing significant improvements in capturing LRDs and enhancement in spatial consistency.

Given just a video, ascertaining where it was captured from can have a plethora of advantages. The problem of worldwide geolocalization has been tackled before, but only using the image modality. Its video counterpart remains relatively unexplored. Meanwhile, video geolocalization has also garnered some attention in the recent past, but the existing methods are all restricted to specific regions. This motivates us to explore the problem of video geolocalization at a global scale. Hence, we propose a novel problem of worldwide video geolocalization with the objective of hierarchically predicting the correct city, state/province, country, and continent, given a video. However, no large scale video datasets that have extensive worldwide coverage exist, to train models for solving this problem. To this end, we introduce a new dataset, CityGuessr68k comprising of 68,269 videos from 166 cities all over the world. We also propose a novel baseline approach to this problem, by designing a transformer-based architecture comprising of an elegant Self-Cross Attention module for incorporating scenes as well as a TextLabel Alignment strategy for distilling knowledge from textlabels in feature space. To further enhance our location prediction, we also utilize soft-scene labels. Finally we demonstrate the performance of our method on our new dataset as well as Mapillary(MSLS).

However, in natural scenes, the spatial arrangement of key instances is often inconsistent across images. This spatial misalignment can result in mismatched semantic pixels, leading to inaccurate similarity measurements. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called the Layer-Wise Features Metric of Semantic-Pixel Matching (LWFM-SPM) to make finer comparisons. Our method enhances model performance through two key modules: (1) the Layer-Wise Embedding (LWE) Module, which refines the cross-correlation of image pairs to generate well-focused feature maps for each layer; (2)the Semantic-Pixel Matching (SPM) Module, which aligns critical pixels based on semantic embeddings using an assignment algorithm. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our method on four widely used few-shot classification benchmarks: miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and CIFAR-FS.

Novel view synthesis methods like NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting are ill-equipped to synthesize from sequences with optical aberrations. To address this challenge, we introduce SynthCover to enable novel view synthesis through protective covers for downstream extended reality applications. SynthCover employs a Refractive Field that estimates the cover's geometry, enabling precise analytical calculation of refracted rays. Experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes demonstrate our method's ability to accurately model scenes viewed through protective covers, achieving a significant improvement in rendering quality compared to prior methods. We also show that the model can adjust well to various cover geometries with synthetic sequences captured with covers of different surface curvatures.

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA.

Specifically for Chinese text recognition, the lack of shape-awareness can lead to confusion among close complex characters. Since such characters are often tail classes that appear less frequently in the training-set, making it harder for the model to capture its shape information. Hence in this work, we propose a structure-aware network utilizing the hierarchical composition information to improve the recognition performance of complex characters. Implementation-wise, we first propose an auxiliary radical branch and integrate it into the base recognition network as a regularization term, which distills hierarchical composition information into the feature extractor. A Tree-Similarity-based weighting mechanism is then proposed to further utilize the depth information in the hierarchical representation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performances of complex characters and tail characters, yielding a better overall performance.

However, rendering quality significantly deteriorates when test views deviate from the camera angles used during training, posing a major challenge for applications in immersive free-viewpoint rendering and navigation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 3DGS and related novel view synthesis methods under out-of-distribution (OOD) test camera scenarios. By creating diverse test cases with synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that most existing methods, including those incorporating various regularization techniques and data-driven priors, struggle to generalize effectively to OOD views. To address this limitation, we introduce SplatFormer, the first point transformer model specifically designed to operate on Gaussian splats. SplatFormer takes as input an initial 3DGS set optimized under limited training views and refines it in a single forward pass, effectively removing potential artifacts in OOD test views. To our knowledge, this is the first successful application of point transformers directly on 3DGS sets, surpassing the limitations of previous multi-scene training methods, which could handle only a restricted number of input views during inference. Our model significantly improves rendering quality under extreme novel views, achieving state-of-the-art performance in these challenging scenarios and outperforming various 3DGS regularization techniques, multi-scene models tailored for sparse view synthesis, and diffusion-based frameworks.",

To address this issue, we propose the Local Implicit Wavelet Transformer (LIWT) to enhance the restoration of high-frequency texture details.

However, most methods require the number and coordinates of gradient directions during testing and training to remain strictly consistent, significantly limiting the generalization and robustness of these models in NODDI parameter estimation. In this paper, we propose a q-space sampling augmentation-based continuous representation learning framework (SamRobNODDI) to achieve robust and generalized NODDI. Specifically, a continuous representation learning method based on q-space sampling augmentation is introduced to fully explore the information between different gradient directions in q-space. Furthermore, we design a sampling consistency loss to constrain the outputs of different sampling schemes, ensuring that the outputs remain as consistent as possible, thereby further enhancing performance and robustness to varying q-space sampling schemes. SamRobNODDI is also a flexible framework that can be applied to different backbone networks. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compared it with 7 state-of-the-art methods across 18 different q-space sampling schemes, demonstrating that the proposed SamRobNODDI has better performance, robustness, generalization, and flexibility.",

While most of existing video VAEs inflate a pretrained image VAE into the 3D causal structure for temporal-spatial compression, this paper presents two astonishing findings: (1) The initialization from a well-trained image VAE with the same latent dimensions suppresses the improvement of subsequent temporal compression capabilities. (2) The adoption of causal reasoning leads to unequal information interactions and unbalanced performance between frames. To alleviate these problems, we propose a keyframe-based temporal compression (KTC) architecture and a group causal convolution (GCConv) module to further improve video VAE (IV-VAE). Specifically, the KTC architecture divides the latent space into two branches, in which one half completely inherits the compression prior of keyframes from a lower-dimension image VAE while the other half involves temporal compression through 3D group causal convolution, reducing temporal-spatial conflicts and accelerating the convergence speed of video VAE. The GCConv in above 3D half uses standard convolution within each frame group to ensure inter-frame equivalence, and employs causal logical padding between groups to maintain flexibility in processing variable frame video.

The restoration of UHD images is a highly challenging problem due to the exaggerated pixel count, which often leads to memory overflow during processing. Existing methods either downsample UHD images at a high rate before processing or split them into multiple patches for separate processing. However, high-rate downsampling leads to significant information loss, while patch-based approaches inevitably introduce boundary artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel design paradigm to solve the UHD image restoration problem, called D2Net. D2Net enables direct full-resolution inference on UHD images without the need for high-rate downsampling or dividing the images into several patches. Specifically, we ingeniously utilize the characteristics of the frequency domain to establish long-range dependencies of features. Taking into account the richer local patterns in UHD images, we also design a multi-scale convolutional group to capture local features. Additionally, during the decoding stage, we dynamically incorporate features from the encoding stage to reduce the flow of irrelevant information.

Compressing these models not only reduces storage requirements, making deployment to edge devices feasible, but also accelerates inference, thereby reducing latency and computational costs. Structured pruning, which removes filters at the layer level, directly modifies the model architecture. This approach achieves a more compact architecture while maintaining target accuracy, ensuring that the compressed model retains good compatibility and hardware efficiency. Our method is based on a key observation: filters in different layers of a neural network have varying importance to the model's performance. When the number of filters to prune is fixed, the optimal pruning distribution across different layers is uneven to minimize performance loss. Layers that are more sensitive to pruning should account for a smaller proportion of the pruning distribution. To leverage this insight, we propose RL-Pruner, which uses reinforcement learning to learn the optimal pruning distribution. RL-Pruner can automatically extract dependencies between filters in the input model and perform pruning, without requiring model-specific pruning implementations.

Such constrained segmentation problem would require a clear definition and specific evaluation criteria. However, the validation framework for superpixel methods, typically viewed as standard object segmentation, has rarely been thoroughly studied. In this work, we first take a step back to show that superpixel segmentation is fundamentally an ill-posed problem, due to the implicit regularity constraint on the shape and size of superpixels. We also demonstrate through a novel comprehensive study that the literature suffers from only evaluating certain aspects, sometimes incorrectly and with inappropriate metrics. Concurrently, recent deep learning-based superpixel methods mainly focus on the object segmentation task at the expense of regularity. In this ill-posed context, we show that we can achieve competitive results using a recent architecture like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), without dedicated training for the superpixel segmentation task.

The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06525v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Video generation technologies are developing rapidly and have broad potential applications. Among these technologies, camera control is crucial for generating professional-quality videos that accurately meet user expectations. However, existing camera control methods still suffer from several limitations, including control precision and the neglect of the control for subject motion dynamics. In this work, we propose I2VControl-Camera, a novel camera control method that significantly enhances controllability while providing adjustability over the strength of subject motion. To improve control precision, we employ point trajectory in the camera coordinate system instead of only extrinsic matrix information as our control signal. To accurately control and adjust the strength of subject motion, we explicitly model the higher-order components of the video trajectory expansion, not merely the linear terms, and design an operator that effectively represents the motion strength. We use an adapter architecture that is independent of the base model structure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes show that our framework outperformances previous methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.",

Regional prompting, or compositional generation, which enables fine-grained spatial control, has gained increasing attention for its practicality in real-world applications. However, previous methods either introduce additional trainable modules, thus only applicable to specific models, or manipulate on score maps within cross-attention layers using attention masks, resulting in limited control strength when the number of regions increases. To handle these limitations, we decouple the multi-region generation into two sub-tasks, the construction of individual region (Regional Hard Binding) that ensures the regional prompt is properly executed, and the overall detail refinement (Regional Soft Refinement) over regions that dismiss the visual boundaries and enhance adjacent interactions. Furthermore, RAG novelly makes repainting feasible, where users can modify specific unsatisfied regions in the last generation while keeping all other regions unchanged, without relying on additional inpainting models. Our approach is tuning-free and applicable to other frameworks as an enhancement to the prompt following property.

It accounts for tissue shape and position changes due to compression, ensuring precise alignment and improved analysis. Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is reliable for approximating soft tissue deformation, it struggles with balancing accuracy and computational efficiency. Recent studies have used data-driven models trained on FEA results to speed up tissue deformation predictions. We propose to explore Physics-based Graph Neural Networks (PhysGNN) for breast compression simulation. PhysGNN has been used for data-driven modelling in other domains, and this work presents the first investigation of their potential in predicting breast deformation during mammographic compression. Unlike conventional data-driven models, PhysGNN, which incorporates mesh structural information and enables inductive learning on unstructured grids, is well-suited for capturing complex breast tissue geometries. Trained on deformations from incremental FEA simulations, PhysGNN's performance is evaluated by comparing predicted nodal displacements with those from finite element (FE) simulations.

Building on these advancements, early methods have been developed for dynamic surface reconstruction by globally optimizing entire sequences. However, reconstructing dynamic scenes with significant topology changes, emerging or disappearing objects, and rapid movements remains a substantial challenge, particularly for long sequences. To address these issues, we propose AT-GS, a novel method for reconstructing high-quality dynamic surfaces from multi-view videos through per-frame incremental optimization. To avoid local minima across frames, we introduce a unified and adaptive gradient-aware densification strategy that integrates the strengths of conventional cloning and splitting techniques. Additionally, we reduce temporal jittering in dynamic surfaces by ensuring consistency in curvature maps across consecutive frames. Our method achieves superior accuracy and temporal coherence in dynamic surface reconstruction, delivering high-fidelity space-time novel view synthesis, even in complex and challenging scenes.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06665v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) has been widely studied due to its ability to utilize a few labeled target data to improve the generalization ability of the model. However, existing methods only consider designing certain strategies for target samples to adapt, ignoring the exploration of customized learning for different target samples. When the model encounters complex target distribution, existing methods will perform limited due to the inability to clearly and comprehensively learn the knowledge of multiple types of target samples. To fill this gap, this paper focuses on designing a framework to use different strategies for comprehensively mining different target samples. We propose a novel source-free framework (SOUF) to achieve semi-supervised fine-tuning of the source pre-trained model on the target domain. Different from existing SSDA methods, SOUF decouples SSDA from the perspectives of different target samples, specifically designing robust learning techniques for unlabeled, reliably labeled, and noisy pseudo-labeled target samples. For unlabeled target samples, probability-based weighted contrastive learning (PWC) helps the model learn more discriminative feature representations. To mine the latent knowledge of labeled target samples, reliability-based mixup contrastive learning (RMC) learns complex knowledge from the constructed reliable sample set. Finally, predictive regularization learning (PR) further mitigates the misleading effect of noisy pseudo-labeled samples on the model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our framework over state-of-the-art methods.",

In the post-AIGC era, controllable generation relies on diffusion models and is accomplished by maintaining certain components or introducing inference interferences. This paper addresses key challenges in controllable generation: 1. mismatched object attributes during generation and poor prompt-following effects; 2. inadequate completion of controllable layouts. We propose a train-free method based on attention loss backward, cleverly controlling the cross attention map. By utilizing external conditions such as prompts that can reasonably map onto the attention map, we can control image generation without any training or fine-tuning. This method addresses issues like attribute mismatch and poor prompt-following while introducing explicit layout constraints for controllable image generation.

Recently, semi-dense matching approaches have achieved substantial performance enhancements and established a widely-accepted coarse-to-fine paradigm. However, the majority of existing methods focus on improving coarse feature representation rather than the fine-matching module. Prior fine-matching techniques, which rely on point-to-patch matching probability expectation or direct regression, often lack precision and do not guarantee the continuity of feature points across sequential images. To address this limitation, this paper concentrates on enhancing the fine-matching module in the semi-dense matching framework. We employ a lightweight and efficient homography estimation network to generate the perspective mapping between patches obtained from coarse matching. This patch-to-patch approach achieves the overall alignment of two patches, resulting in a higher sub-pixel accuracy by incorporating additional constraints. By leveraging the homography estimation between patches, we can achieve a dense matching result with low computational cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy compared to previous semi-dense matchers. Meanwhile, our dense matching results exhibit similar end-point-error accuracy compared to previous dense matchers while maintaining semi-dense efficiency.",

We observe that existing ORSIs-SOD methods consistently center around optimizing pixel features in the spatial domain, progressively distinguishing between backgrounds and objects. However, pixel information represents local attributes, which are often correlated with their surrounding context. Even with strategies expanding the local region, spatial features remain biased towards local characteristics, lacking the ability of global perception. To address this problem, we introduce the Fourier transform that generate global frequency features and achieve an image-size receptive field. To be specific, we propose a novel United Domain Cognition Network (UDCNet) to jointly explore the global-local information in the frequency and spatial domains. Technically, we first design a frequency-spatial domain transformer block that mutually amalgamates the complementary local spatial and global frequency features to strength the capability of initial input features. Furthermore, a dense semantic excavation module is constructed to capture higher-level semantic for guiding the positioning of remote sensing objects. Finally, we devise a dual-branch joint optimization decoder that applies the saliency and edge branches to generate high-quality representations for predicting salient objects.

Recently deep neural networks have been used for implicit shape representations (DeepSDFs) due to their ability to represent multiple shapes with modest memory requirements compared to traditional representations over dense grids. However, the computational expense of DeepSDFs prevents their use in real-time clothing simulation applications. We design a learning-based representation of SDFs for human avatars whoes bodies change shape kinematically due to joint-based skinning. Rather than using a single DeepSDF for the entire avatar, we use a collection of extremely computationally efficient (shallow) neural networks that represent localized deformations arising from changes in body shape induced by the variation of a single joint. This requires a stitching process to combine each shallow SDF in the collection together into one SDF representing the signed closest distance to the boundary of the entire body. To achieve this we augment each shallow SDF with an additional output that resolves whether or not the individual shallow SDF value is referring to a closest point on the boundary of the body, or to a point on the interior of the body (but on the boundary of the individual shallow SDF).

However, hand-held low-light photography challenges NeRFs as the captured images may simultaneously suffer from low visibility, noise, and camera shakes. While existing NeRF methods may handle either low light or motion, directly combining them or incorporating additional image-based enhancement methods does not work as these degradation factors are highly coupled. We observe that noise in low-light images is always sharp regardless of camera shakes, which implies an implicit order of these degradation factors within the image formation process. To this end, we propose in this paper a novel model, named LuSh-NeRF, which can reconstruct a clean and sharp NeRF from a group of hand-held low-light images. The key idea of LuSh-NeRF is to sequentially model noise and blur in the images via multi-view feature consistency and frequency information of NeRF, respectively. Specifically, LuSh-NeRF includes a novel Scene-Noise Decomposition (SND) module for decoupling the noise from the scene representation and a novel Camera Trajectory Prediction (CTP) module for the estimation of camera motions based on low-frequency scene information.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06764v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs), pre-trained on large-scale image-text datasets, enable zero-shot predictions for unseen data but may underperform on specific unseen tasks. Continual learning (CL) can help VLMs effectively adapt to new data distributions without joint training, but faces challenges of catastrophic forgetting and generalization forgetting. Although significant progress has been achieved by distillation-based methods, they exhibit two severe limitations. One is the popularly adopted single-teacher paradigm fails to impart comprehensive knowledge, The other is the existing methods inadequately leverage the multimodal information in the original training dataset, instead they rely on additional data for distillation, which increases computational and storage overhead. To mitigate both limitations, by drawing on Knowledge Integration Theory (KIT), we propose a Multi-Stage Knowledge Integration network (MulKI) to emulate the human learning process in distillation methods. MulKI achieves this through four stages, including Eliciting Ideas, Adding New Ideas, Distinguishing Ideas, and Making Connections. During the four stages, we first leverage prototypes to align across modalities, eliciting cross-modal knowledge, then adding new knowledge by constructing fine-grained intra- and inter-modality relationships with prototypes. After that, knowledge from two teacher models is adaptively distinguished and re-weighted. Finally, we connect between models from intra- and inter-task, integrating preceding and new knowledge. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in maintaining zero-shot capabilities while supporting continual learning across diverse downstream tasks, showcasing its potential in adapting VLMs to evolving data distributions.",

But modern video-analysis efforts such as detection and recognition, which are integral to video surveillance and autonomous vehicles, involve so much data that they necessitate machine-vision processing with minimal human intervention. In such cases, the video codec must be optimized for machine vision. This paper explores the effects of compression on detection and recognition algorithms (objects, faces, and license plates) and introduces novel full-reference image/video-quality metrics for each task, tailored to machine vision. Experimental results indicate our proposed metrics correlate better with the machine-vision results for the respective tasks than do existing image/video-quality metrics.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06780v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In camera-based 3D multi-object tracking (MOT), the prevailing methods follow the tracking-by-query-propagation paradigm, which employs track queries to manage the lifecycle of identity-consistent tracklets while object queries handle the detection of new-born tracklets. However, this intertwined paradigm leads the inter-temporal tracking task and the single-frame detection task utilize the same model parameters, complicating training optimization. Drawing inspiration from studies on the roles of attention components in transformer-based decoders, we identify that the dispersing effect of self-attention necessitates object queries to match with new-born tracklets. This matching strategy diverges from the detection pre-training phase, where object queries align with all ground-truth targets, resulting in insufficient supervision signals. To address these issues, we present HSTrack, a novel plug-and-play method designed to co-facilitate multi-task learning for detection and tracking. HSTrack constructs a parallel weight-share decoder devoid of self-attention layers, circumventing competition between different types of queries. Considering the characteristics of cross-attention layer and distinct query types, our parallel decoder adopt one-to-one and one-to-many label assignment strategies for track queries and object queries, respectively. Leveraging the shared architecture, HSTrack further improve trackers for spatio-temporal modeling and quality candidates generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HSTrack consistently delivers improvements when integrated with various query-based 3D MOT trackers. For example, HSTrack improves the state-of-the-art PF-Track method by $+2.3\\%$ AMOTA and $+1.7\\%$ mAP on the nuScenes dataset.",

To make this possible, our analysis underlines the importance of seeking effective strategies to align (1) feature computing paradigm differences, (2) model scale differences, and (3) knowledge density differences. By combining three coupled components namely cross attention projector, dual-view feature mimicking and teacher parameter perception tailored to address the above problems, we present a simple and effective KD method, called ScaleKD.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06851v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Accurate object detection and prediction are critical to ensure the safety and efficiency of self-driving architectures. Predicting object trajectories and occupancy enables autonomous vehicles to anticipate movements and make decisions with future information, increasing their adaptability and reducing the risk of accidents. Current State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) approaches often isolate the detection, tracking, and prediction stages, which can lead to significant prediction errors due to accumulated inaccuracies between stages. Recent advances have improved the feature representation of multi-camera perception systems through Bird's-Eye View (BEV) transformations, boosting the development of end-to-end systems capable of predicting environmental elements directly from vehicle sensor data. These systems, however, often suffer from high processing times and number of parameters, creating challenges for real-world deployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel BEV instance prediction architecture based on a simplified paradigm that relies only on instance segmentation and flow prediction. The proposed system prioritizes speed, aiming at reduced parameter counts and inference times compared to existing SOTA architectures, thanks to the incorporation of an efficient transformer-based architecture.

Recent efforts have begun exploring the use of text-based queries, where the need for support keypoints is eliminated. However, the optimal use of textual descriptions for keypoints remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CapeLLM, a novel approach that leverages a text-based multimodal large language model (MLLM) for CAPE.

We conduct extensive experiments to systematically explore the design space of LLM-based CAPE, investigating factors such as choosing the optimal description for keypoints, neural network architectures, and training strategies. Thanks to the advanced reasoning capabilities of the pre-trained MLLM, CapeLLM demonstrates superior generalization and robust performance.

However, existing algorithms often fail to effectively integrate multi-scale feature extraction with frequency enhancement, limiting their ability to reconstruct fine textures. Additionally, non-uniform blur in images also restricts the effectiveness of image restoration. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale frequency enhancement network (MFENet) for blind image deblurring.

We propose a frequency enhanced blur perception module (FEBP) that employs wavelet transforms to extract high-frequency details and utilizes multi-strip pooling to perceive non-uniform blur, combining multi-scale information with frequency enhancement to improve the restoration of image texture details. Experimental results on the GoPro and HIDE datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior deblurring performance in both visual quality and objective evaluation metrics.

The increasing availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), coupled with advances in machine learning, has opened new opportunities for wildlife monitoring using aerial tracking. However, limited availability of datasets with wild animals in natural habitats has hindered progress in automated computer vision solutions for long-term animal tracking. Here we introduce BuckTales, the first large-scale UAV dataset designed to solve multi-object tracking (MOT) and re-identification (Re-ID) problem in wild animals, specifically the mating behaviour (or lekking) of blackbuck antelopes.

The Re-ID dataset includes 730 individuals captured with two UAVs simultaneously. The dataset is designed to drive scalable, long-term animal behaviour tracking using multiple camera sensors. By providing baseline performance with two detectors, and benchmarking several state-of-the-art tracking methods, our dataset reflects the real-world challenges of tracking wild animals in socially and ecologically relevant contexts.

But they still struggle with domain shifts and typically require labeled data to adapt to downstream tasks, which could be costly. In this work, we aim to leverage unlabeled data that naturally spans multiple domains to enhance the transferability of vision-language models. Under this unsupervised multi-domain setting, we have identified inherent model bias within CLIP, notably in its visual and text encoders. Specifically, we observe that CLIP's visual encoder tends to prioritize encoding domain over discriminative category information, meanwhile its text encoder exhibits a preference for domain-relevant classes. To mitigate this model bias, we propose a training-free and label-free feature calibration method, Unsupervised Multi-domain Feature Calibration (UMFC). UMFC estimates image-level biases from domain-specific features and text-level biases from the direction of domain transition. These biases are subsequently subtracted from original image and text features separately, to render them domain-invariant. We evaluate our method on multiple settings including transductive learning and test-time adaptation.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06959v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Recently, token-based generation have demonstrated their effectiveness in image synthesis. As a representative example, non-autoregressive Transformers (NATs) can generate decent-quality images in a few steps. NATs perform generation in a progressive manner, where the latent tokens of a resulting image are incrementally revealed. At each step, the unrevealed image regions are padded with mask tokens and inferred by NAT. In this paper, we delve into the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of NATs and uncover two important patterns that naturally emerge from NATs: Spatially (within a step), although mask and visible tokens are processed uniformly by NATs, the interactions between them are highly asymmetric. In specific, mask tokens mainly gather information for decoding, while visible tokens tend to primarily provide information, and their deep representations can be built only upon themselves. Temporally (across steps), the interactions between adjacent generation steps mostly concentrate on updating the representations of a few critical tokens, while the computation for the majority of tokens is generally repetitive. Driven by these findings, we propose EfficientNAT (ENAT), a NAT model that explicitly encourages these critical interactions inherent in NATs. At the spatial level, we disentangle the computations of visible and mask tokens by encoding visible tokens independently, while decoding mask tokens conditioned on the fully encoded visible tokens. At the temporal level, we prioritize the computation of the critical tokens at each step, while maximally reusing previously computed token representations to supplement necessary information. ENAT improves the performance of NATs notably with significantly reduced computational cost. Experiments on ImageNet-256, ImageNet-512 and MS-COCO validate the effectiveness of ENAT.

Recently, ensemble-based models (ESM) have been shown to offer significant robustness improvement, while preserving high ID accuracy. However, our study finds that ESMs do not solve the ID-OOD trade-offs: they achieve peak performance for ID and OOD accuracy at different mixing coefficients. When optimized for OOD accuracy, the ensemble model exhibits a noticeable decline in ID accuracy, and vice versa. In contrast, we propose a sample-wise ensembling technique that can simultaneously attain the best ID and OOD accuracy without the trade-offs. Specifically, we construct a Zero-Shot Failure (ZSF) set containing training samples incorrectly predicted by the zero-shot model. For each test sample, we calculate its distance to the ZSF set and assign a higher weight to the fine-tuned model in the ensemble if the distance is small. We term our method Variance Reduction Fine-tuning (VRF), as it effectively reduces the variance in ensemble predictions, thereby decreasing residual error. On ImageNet and five derived distribution shifts, our VRF further improves the OOD accuracy by 1.5 - 2.0 pp over the ensemble baselines while maintaining or increasing ID accuracy. VRF achieves similar large robustness gains (0.9 - 3.1 pp) on other distribution shifts benchmarks. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/VRF.",

However, this process is often constrained by the time-consuming task of manually digitizing sufficient high-quality training data. The emergence of visual foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), offers a promising solution due to their remarkable generalization capabilities and rapid adaptation to new data distributions. Despite this, directly applying SAM in a zero-shot manner to historical map segmentation poses significant challenges, including poor recognition of certain geospatial features and a reliance on input prompts, which limits its ability to be fully automated. To address these challenges, we introduce MapSAM, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts SAM into a prompt-free and versatile solution for various downstream historical map segmentation tasks. Specifically, we employ Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) to integrate domain-specific knowledge into the image encoder. Additionally, we develop an automatic prompt generation process, eliminating the need for manual input. We further enhance the positional prompt in SAM, transforming it into a higher-level positional-semantic prompt, and modify the cross-attention mechanism in the mask decoder with masked attention for more effective feature aggregation. The proposed MapSAM framework demonstrates promising performance across two distinct historical map segmentation tasks: one focused on linear features and the other on areal features. Experimental results show that it adapts well to various features, even when fine-tuned with extremely limited data (e.g. 10 shots).",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06976v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) demonstrates excellent rendering quality and generation speed in novel view synthesis. However, substantial data size poses challenges for storage and transmission, making 3D GS compression an essential technology. Current 3D GS compression research primarily focuses on developing more compact scene representations, such as converting explicit 3D GS data into implicit forms. In contrast, compression of the GS data itself has hardly been explored. To address this gap, we propose a Hierarchical GS Compression (HGSC) technique. Initially, we prune unimportant Gaussians based on importance scores derived from both global and local significance, effectively reducing redundancy while maintaining visual quality. An Octree structure is used to compress 3D positions. Based on the 3D GS Octree, we implement a hierarchical attribute compression strategy by employing a KD-tree to partition the 3D GS into multiple blocks. We apply farthest point sampling to select anchor primitives within each block and others as non-anchor primitives with varying Levels of Details (LoDs). Anchor primitives serve as reference points for predicting non-anchor primitives across different LoDs to reduce spatial redundancy. For anchor primitives, we use the region adaptive hierarchical transform to achieve near-lossless compression of various attributes. For non-anchor primitives, each is predicted based on the k-nearest anchor primitives. To further minimize prediction errors, the reconstructed LoD and anchor primitives are combined to form new anchor primitives to predict the next LoD. Our method notably achieves superior compression quality and a significant data size reduction of over 4.5 times compared to the state-of-the-art compression method on small scenes datasets.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06991v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: The ambiguity at the boundaries of different semantic classes in point cloud semantic segmentation often leads to incorrect decisions in intelligent perception systems, such as autonomous driving. Hence, accurate delineation of the boundaries is crucial for improving safety in autonomous driving. A novel spatial inter-correlation enhancement and spatially-embedded feature fusion network (SIESEF-FusionNet) is proposed in this paper, enhancing spatial inter-correlation by combining inverse distance weighting and angular compensation to extract more beneficial spatial information without causing redundancy. Meanwhile, a new spatial adaptive pooling module is also designed, embedding enhanced spatial information into semantic features for strengthening the context-awareness of semantic features. Experimental results demonstrate that 83.7% mIoU and 97.8% OA are achieved by SIESEF-FusionNet on the Toronto3D dataset, with performance superior to other baseline methods. A value of 61.1% mIoU is reached on the semanticKITTI dataset, where a marked improvement in segmentation performance is observed. In addition, the effectiveness and plug-and-play capability of the proposed modules are further verified through ablation studies.",

In this work, we propose an automatic and interpretable X-ray style transfer by introducing a trainable version of the Local Laplacian Filter (LLF). From the shape of the LLF's optimized remap function, the characteristics of the style transfer can be inferred and reliability of the algorithm can be ensured. Moreover, we enable the LLF to capture complex X-ray style features by replacing the remap function with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and adding a trainable normalization layer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by transforming unprocessed mammographic X-ray images into images that match the style of target mammograms and achieve a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.94 compared to 0.82 of the baseline LLF style transfer method from Aubry et al.",

To increase rosacea awareness, automatic rosacea detection methods using deep learning and explainable statistical approaches are presented in this paper. The deep learning method applies the ResNet-18 for rosacea detection, and the statistical approaches utilize the means of the two classes, namely, the rosacea class vs. the normal class, and the principal component analysis to extract features from the facial images for automatic rosacea detection. The contributions of the proposed methods are three-fold. First, the proposed methods are able to automatically distinguish patients who are suffering from rosacea from people who are clean of this disease. Second, the statistical approaches address the explainability issue that allows doctors and patients to understand and trust the results. And finally, the proposed methods will not only help increase rosacea awareness in the general population but also help remind the patients who suffer from this disease of possible early treatment since rosacea is more treatable at its early stages.

Long video description introduces new challenges, such as plot-level consistency across descriptions. To address these, we figure out audio-visual character identification, matching character names to each dialogue, as a key factor. We propose StoryTeller, a system for generating dense descriptions of long videos, incorporating both low-level visual concepts and high-level plot information. StoryTeller uses a multimodal large language model that integrates visual, audio, and text modalities to perform audio-visual character identification on minute-long video clips. The results are then fed into a LVLM to enhance consistency of video description. We validate our approach on movie description tasks and introduce MovieStory101, a dataset with dense descriptions for three-minute movie clips. To evaluate long video descriptions, we create MovieQA, a large set of multiple-choice questions for the MovieStory101 test set. We assess descriptions by inputting them into GPT-4 to answer these questions, using accuracy as an automatic evaluation metric. Experiments show that StoryTeller outperforms all open and closed-source baselines on MovieQA, achieving 9.5% higher accuracy than the strongest baseline, Gemini-1.5-pro, and demonstrating a +15.56% advantage in human side-by-side evaluations. Additionally, incorporating audio-visual character identification from StoryTeller improves the performance of all video description models, with Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o showing relative improvement of 5.5% and 13.0%, respectively, in accuracy on MovieQA.",

Yet, while the field sees continual development of novel methods, a lack of agreed-upon benchmarks limits their systematic comparison and evaluation: Current UQ methods are typically tested either on overly simplistic toy datasets or on complex real-world datasets that do not allow to discern true uncertainty. To unify both controllability and complexity, we introduce Arctique, a procedurally generated dataset modeled after histopathological colon images. We chose histopathological images for two reasons: 1) their complexity in terms of intricate object structures and highly variable appearance, which yields challenging segmentation problems, and 2) their broad prevalence for medical diagnosis and respective relevance of high-quality UQ. To generate Arctique, we established a Blender-based framework for 3D scene creation with intrinsic noise manipulation. Arctique contains 50,000 rendered images with precise masks as well as noisy label simulations. We show that by independently controlling the uncertainty in both images and labels, we can effectively study the performance of several commonly used UQ methods. Hence, Arctique serves as a critical resource for benchmarking and advancing UQ techniques and other methodologies in complex, multi-object environments, bridging the gap between realism and controllability. All code is publicly available, allowing re-creation and controlled manipulations of our shipped images as well as creation and rendering of new scenes.",

With the growing interest in transformer-based architectures, they are now utilized for gesture recognition. So, we also explore and devise a novel ConvMixFormer architecture for dynamic hand gestures. The transformers use quadratic scaling of the attention features with the sequential data, due to which these models are computationally complex and heavy. We have considered this drawback of the transformer and designed a resource-efficient model that replaces the self-attention in the transformer with the simple convolutional layer-based token mixer. The computational cost and the parameters used for the convolution-based mixer are comparatively less than the quadratic self-attention. Convolution-mixer helps the model capture the local spatial features that self-attention struggles to capture due to their sequential processing nature. Further, an efficient gate mechanism is employed instead of a conventional feed-forward network in the transformer to help the model control the flow of features within different stages of the proposed model. This design uses fewer learnable parameters which is nearly half the vanilla transformer that helps in fast and efficient training. The proposed method is evaluated on NVidia Dynamic Hand Gesture and Briareo datasets and our model has achieved state-of-the-art results on single and multimodal inputs. We have also shown the parameter efficiency of the proposed ConvMixFormer model compared to other methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/mallikagarg/ConvMixFormer.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.07121v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Neural decoding, the process of understanding how brain activity corresponds to different stimuli, has been a primary objective in cognitive sciences. Over the past three decades, advancements in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and machine learning have greatly improved our ability to map visual stimuli to brain activity, especially in the visual cortex. Concurrently, research has expanded into decoding more complex processes like language and memory across the whole brain, utilizing techniques to handle greater variability and improve signal accuracy. We argue that \"seeing\" involves more than just mapping visual stimuli onto the visual cortex; it engages the entire brain, as various emotions and cognitive states can emerge from observing different scenes. In this paper, we develop algorithms to enhance our understanding of visual processes by incorporating whole-brain activation maps while individuals are exposed to visual stimuli. We utilize large-scale fMRI encoders and Image generative models pre-trained on large public datasets, which are then fine-tuned through Image-fMRI contrastive learning. Our models hence can decode visual experience across the entire cerebral cortex, surpassing the traditional confines of the visual cortex. We first compare our method with state-of-the-art approaches to decoding visual processing and show improved predictive semantic accuracy by 43%. A network ablation analysis suggests that beyond the visual cortex, the default mode network contributes most to decoding stimuli, in line with the proposed role of this network in sense-making and semantic processing. Additionally, we implemented zero-shot imagination decoding on an extra validation dataset, achieving a p-value of 0.0206 for mapping the reconstructed images and ground-truth text stimuli, which substantiates the model's capability to capture semantic meanings across various scenarios.",

Previous approaches either involve intensive fine-tuning of the entire T2I model or require users or large language models to specify generation layouts, adding complexity. In this paper, we define semantic binding as the task of associating a given object with its attribute, termed attribute binding, or linking it to other related sub-objects, referred to as object binding. We introduce a novel method called Token Merging (ToMe), which enhances semantic binding by aggregating relevant tokens into a single composite token. This ensures that the object, its attributes and sub-objects all share the same cross-attention map. Additionally, to address potential confusion among main objects with complex textual prompts, we propose end token substitution as a complementary strategy. To further refine our approach in the initial stages of T2I generation, where layouts are determined, we incorporate two auxiliary losses, an entropy loss and a semantic binding loss, to iteratively update the composite token to improve the generation integrity. We conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ToMe, comparing it against various existing methods on the T2I-CompBench and our proposed GPT-4o object binding benchmark. Our method is particularly effective in complex scenarios that involve multiple objects and attributes, which previous methods often fail to address.

Based on the observation that the channel dimension of feature maps essentially represents the linear bases of the heatmap space, we propose learning the interconnections between these linear bases to model the inherent geometric relations among landmarks via Channel-split ViT. We integrate such channel-split ViT into the standard vision transformer (i.e., spatial-split ViT), forming our Dual Vision Transformer to constitute the prediction blocks. We also suggest using long skip connections to deliver low-level image features to all prediction blocks, thereby preventing useful information from being discarded by intermediate supervision.

For flexibility, we distill scale-conditioned part-aware 3D features for 3D part segmentation at multiple granularities.

However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \\omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \\omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild.

While this generative data expansion may suffice for easier visual tasks, we explore its efficacy on a more difficult discriminative task: clothes-changing person re-identification (CC-ReID). CC-ReID aims to match people appearing in non-overlapping cameras, even when they change their clothes across cameras. Not only are current CC-ReID models constrained by the limited diversity of clothing in current CC-ReID datasets, but generating additional data that retains important personal features for accurate identification is a current challenge. To address this issue we propose DLCR, a novel data expansion framework that leverages pre-trained diffusion and large language models (LLMs) to accurately generate diverse images of individuals in varied attire. We generate additional data for five benchmark CC-ReID datasets (PRCC, CCVID, LaST, VC-Clothes, and LTCC) and \\textbf{increase their clothing diversity by \\boldmath{$10$}x, totaling over \\boldmath{$2.1$}M images generated}. DLCR employs diffusion-based text-guided inpainting, conditioned on clothing prompts constructed using LLMs, to generate synthetic data that only modifies a subject's clothes while preserving their personally identifiable features. With this massive increase in data, we introduce two novel strategies - progressive learning and test-time prediction refinement - that respectively reduce training time and further boosts CC-ReID performance.

This curation process is often expensive and requires throwing away precious annotated data to balance the frequency across classes. This is because the distribution of data in the world (e.g., internet, etc.) significantly differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets perform suboptimally when used to learn from imperfect datasets with long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. For deep models to be widely used, getting away with the costly curation process by developing robust algorithms that can learn from real-world data distribution is necessary. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep Neural Networks that can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the real world. These works are divided into four segments, each covering a scenario of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the works focuses on Learning Generative Models for Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate the mode-collapse for tail (minority) classes and enable diverse aesthetic image generations as head (majority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes to generalize as the head classes without enforcing explicit generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing Relevant Metrics compared to the average accuracy for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation (semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the effective domain adaptation of the model to various domains with zero to very few labeled samples.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.07232v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Adding Object into images based on text instructions is a challenging task in semantic image editing, requiring a balance between preserving the original scene and seamlessly integrating the new object in a fitting location. Despite extensive efforts, existing models often struggle with this balance, particularly with finding a natural location for adding an object in complex scenes. We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion models' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources: the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted extended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details while ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image insertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed \"Additing Affordance Benchmark\" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming supervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80% of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.",

In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmark suite for assessing VLA models. We profile three state-of-the-art VLM and VLAs - GPT-4o, OpenVLA, and JAT - across 20 diverse datasets from the Open-X-Embodiment collection, evaluating their performance on various manipulation tasks. Our analysis reveals several key insights: 1. current VLA models show significant variation in performance across different tasks and robot platforms, with GPT-4o demonstrating the most consistent performance through sophisticated prompt engineering, 2. all models struggle with complex manipulation tasks requiring multi-step planning, and 3. model performance is notably sensitive to action space characteristics and environmental factors.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05824v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.",

While graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing regional differences, they encounter challenges when dealing with complex, high-density graph structures. In this work, we consider the cortical surface mesh as a sparse graph and propose an interpretable prediction model-Surface Graph Neural Network (SurfGNN). SurfGNN employs topology-sampling learning (TSL) and region-specific learning (RSL) structures to manage individual cortical features at both lower and higher scales of the surface mesh, effectively tackling the challenges posed by the overly abundant mesh nodes and addressing the issue of heterogeneity in cortical regions. Building on this, a novel score-weighted fusion (SWF) method is implemented to merge nodal representations associated with each cortical feature for prediction. We apply our model to a neonatal brain age prediction task using a dataset of harmonized MR images from 481 subjects (503 scans). SurfGNN outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating an improvement of at least 9.0% and achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.827+0.056 in postmenstrual weeks. Furthermore, it generates feature-level activation maps, indicating its capability to identify robust regional variations in different morphometric contributions for prediction.",

This paper addresses how agents can recognize \"when\" they lack sufficient information, without focusing on \"what\" is missing, particularly in VLN tasks with vague instructions. Equipping agents with this ability enhances efficiency by reducing potential digressions and seeking timely assistance. The challenge in identifying such uncertain points is balancing between being overly cautious (high recall) and overly confident (high precision). We propose an attention-based instruction-vagueness estimation module that learns associations between instructions and the agent's trajectory. By leveraging instruction-to-path alignment information during training, the module's vagueness estimation performance improves by around 52% in terms of precision-recall balance. In our ablative experiments, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating this additional instruction-to-path attention network alongside the cross-modal attention networks within the navigator module. Our results show that the attention scores from the instruction-to-path attention network serve as better indicators for estimating vagueness.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05846v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Deep learning models generally display catastrophic forgetting when learning new data continuously. Many incremental learning approaches address this problem by reusing data from previous tasks while learning new tasks. However, the direct access to past data generates privacy and security concerns. To address these issues, we present a novel method that preserves previous knowledge without storing previous data. This method is inspired by the architecture of a vision transformer and employs a unique token capable of encapsulating the compressed knowledge of each task. This approach generates task-specific embeddings by directing attention differently based on the task associated with the data, thereby effectively mimicking the impact of having multiple models through tokens. Our method incorporates a distillation process that ensures efficient interactions even after multiple additional learning steps, thereby optimizing the model against forgetting. We measured the performance of our model in terms of accuracy and backward transfer using a benchmark dataset for different task-incremental learning scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, which achieved the highest accuracy and lowest backward transfer among the compared methods. In addition to presenting a new model, our approach lays the foundation for various extensions within the spectrum of vision-transformer architectures.",

These platforms expose users to harmful content, ranging from clickbait or physical harms to misinformation or online hate. Yet, detecting harmful videos remains challenging due to an inconsistent understanding of what constitutes harm and limited resources and mental tolls involved in human annotation. As such, this study advances measures and methods to detect harm in video content. First, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy for online harm on video platforms, categorizing it into six categories: Information, Hate and harassment, Addictive, Clickbait, Sexual, and Physical harms. Next, we establish multimodal large language models as reliable annotators of harmful videos. We analyze 19,422 YouTube videos using 14 image frames, 1 thumbnail, and text metadata, comparing the accuracy of crowdworkers (Mturk) and GPT-4-Turbo with domain expert annotations serving as the gold standard. Our results demonstrate that GPT-4-Turbo outperforms crowdworkers in both binary classification (harmful vs. harmless) and multi-label harm categorization tasks. Methodologically, this study extends the application of LLMs to multi-label and multi-modal contexts beyond text annotation and binary classification. Practically, our study contributes to online harm mitigation by guiding the definitions and identification of harmful content on video platforms.",

The investigation focuses on understanding the behaviour of the Ping 360 in controlled environments and assessing its suitability for object detection, particularly in scenarios where human operators are unavailable for inspecting offshore structures in shallow waters. Through a series of carefully designed experiments, we examined the effects of surface reflections and object shadows in shallow underwater environments. Additionally, we developed a manually annotated sonar image dataset to train a U-Net segmentation model. Our findings indicate that while the Ping 360 sonar demonstrates potential in simpler settings, its performance is limited in more cluttered or reflective environments unless extensive data pre-processing and annotation are applied. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the Ping 360's capabilities for complex object detection.

However, implementing BP-based training on various edge devices such as FPGA, microcontrollers (MCUs), and analog computing platforms face multiple major challenges, such as the lack of hardware resources, long time-to-market, and dramatic errors in a low-precision setting. This paper presents a simple BP-free training scheme on an MCU, which makes edge training hardware design as easy as inference hardware design. We adopt a quantized zeroth-order method to estimate the gradients of quantized model parameters, which can overcome the error of a straight-through estimator in a low-precision BP scheme. We further employ a few dimension reduction methods (e.g., node perturbation, sparse training) to improve the convergence of zeroth-order training. Experiment results show that our BP-free training achieves comparable performance as BP-based training on adapting a pre-trained image classifier to various corrupted data on resource-constrained edge devices (e.g., an MCU with 1024-KB SRAM for dense full-model training, or an MCU with 256-KB SRAM for sparse training).

To address this uncharted territory, we extend the Non-Cartesian Primal-Dual Network (NC-PDNet), a state-of-the-art unrolled neural network, to a 3D multi-coil setting. We evaluated the impact of channel-specific versus channel-agnostic training configurations and examined the effect of coil compression.

Therefore, automatic image denoising using deep learning methods is of high interest. MR images containing line-like structures such as roots or vessels yield special characteristics as they display connected structures and yield sparse information. For this kind of data, it is important to consider voxel neighborhoods when training a denoising network. In this paper, we translate the Perceptual Loss to 3D data by comparing feature maps of untrained networks in the loss function as done previously for 2D data. We tested the performance of untrained Perceptual Loss (uPL) on 3D image denoising of MR images displaying brain vessels (MR angiograms - MRA) and images of plant roots in soil. We investigate the impact of various uPL characteristics such as weight initialization, network depth, kernel size, and pooling operations on the results. We tested the performance of the uPL loss on four Rician noise levels using evaluation metrics such as the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). We observe, that our uPL outperforms conventional loss functions such as the L1 loss or a loss based on the Structural Similarity Index Metric (SSIM). The uPL network's initialization is not important, while network depth and pooling operations impact denoising performance. E.g. for both datasets a network with five convolutional layers led to the best performance while a network with more layers led to a performance drop. We also find that small uPL networks led to better or comparable results than using large networks such as VGG. We observe superior performance of our loss for both datasets, all noise levels, and three network architectures. In conclusion, for images containing line-like structures, uPL is an alternative to other loss functions for 3D image denoising.",

In contrast to existing IQT methods which adopt supervised learning frameworks, in this work, we propose two novel formulations of the IQT problem. The first approach uses an unsupervised learning framework, whereas the second is a combination of both supervised and unsupervised learning. The unsupervised learning approach considers a sparse representation (SRep) and dictionary learning model, which we call IQT-SRep, whereas the combination of supervised and unsupervised learning approach is based on deep dictionary learning (DDL), which we call IQT-DDL. The IQT-SRep approach trains two dictionaries using a SRep model using pairs of low- and high-quality volumes. Subsequently, the SRep of a low-quality block, in terms of the low-quality dictionary, can be directly used to recover the corresponding high-quality block using the high-quality dictionary. On the other hand, the IQT-DDL approach explicitly learns a high-resolution dictionary to upscale the input volume, while the entire network, including high dictionary generator, is simultaneously optimised to take full advantage of deep learning methods. The two models are evaluated using a low-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) application aiming to recover high-quality images akin to those obtained from high-field scanners. Experiments comparing the proposed approaches against state-of-the-art supervised deep learning IQT method (IQT-DL) identify that the two novel formulations of the IQT problem can avoid bias associated with supervised methods when tested using out-of-distribution data that differs from the distribution of the data the model was trained on.

As such, these polyp biopsies make up the bulk of a pathologist's workload. Developing an efficient computational model to help screen these polyp biopsies can improve the pathologist's workflow and help guide their attention to critical areas on the slide. DL models face significant challenges in computational pathology (CPath) because of the gigapixel image size of whole-slide images and the scarcity of detailed annotated datasets. It is, therefore, crucial to leverage self-supervised learning (SSL) methods to alleviate the burden and cost of data annotation. However, current research lacks methods to apply SSL frameworks to analyze pathology data effectively. This paper aims to propose an optimized Barlow Twins framework for colorectal polyps screening.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.05985v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: This paper examines potential biases and inconsistencies in emotional evocation of images produced by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models and their potential bias toward negative emotions. In particular, we assess this bias by comparing the emotions evoked by an AI-produced image to the emotions evoked by prompts used to create those images. As a first step, the study evaluates three approaches for identifying emotions in images -- traditional supervised learning, zero-shot learning with vision-language models, and cross-modal auto-captioning -- using EmoSet, a large dataset of image-emotion annotations that categorizes images across eight emotional types. Results show fine-tuned models, particularly Google's Vision Transformer (ViT), significantly outperform zero-shot and caption-based methods in recognizing emotions in images. For a cross-modality comparison, we then analyze the differences between emotions in text prompts -- via existing text-based emotion-recognition models -- and the emotions evoked in the resulting images. Findings indicate that AI-generated images frequently lean toward negative emotional content, regardless of the original prompt. This emotional skew in generative models could amplify negative affective content in digital spaces, perpetuating its prevalence and impact. The study advocates for a multidisciplinary approach to better align AI emotion recognition with psychological insights and address potential biases in generative AI outputs across digital media.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06160v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Text emotion detection constitutes a crucial foundation for advancing artificial intelligence from basic comprehension to the exploration of emotional reasoning. Most existing emotion detection datasets rely on manual annotations, which are associated with high costs, substantial subjectivity, and severe label imbalances. This is particularly evident in the inadequate annotation of micro-emotions and the absence of emotional intensity representation, which fail to capture the rich emotions embedded in sentences and adversely affect the quality of downstream task completion. By proposing an all-labels and training-set label regression method, we map label values to energy intensity levels, thereby fully leveraging the learning capabilities of machine models and the interdependencies among labels to uncover multiple emotions within samples. This led to the establishment of the Emotion Quantization Network (EQN) framework for micro-emotion detection and annotation. Using five commonly employed sentiment datasets, we conducted comparative experiments with various models, validating the broad applicability of our framework within NLP machine learning models. Based on the EQN framework, emotion detection and annotation are conducted on the GoEmotions dataset. A comprehensive comparison with the results from Google literature demonstrates that the EQN framework possesses a high capability for automatic detection and annotation of micro-emotions. The EQN framework is the first to achieve automatic micro-emotion annotation with energy-level scores, providing strong support for further emotion detection analysis and the quantitative research of emotion computing.",

To investigate the influence of various image discretization methods on diagnosis, it is common practice to evaluate multiple discretization strategies individually.

This study examines the feasibility of employing multi-task Bayesian optimization to accelerate the hyperparameters search for classifying benign and malignant pulmonary nodules using RBF SVM.

Zero-Shot NAS accelerates the evaluation by utilizing zero-cost proxies instead of training. Though effective, existing zero-cost proxies require invoking backpropagations or running networks on input data, making it difficult to further accelerate the computation of proxies. To alleviate this issue, architecture topologies are used to evaluate the performance of networks in this study. We prove that particular architectural topologies decrease the local entropy of feature maps, which degrades specific features to a bias, thereby reducing network performance. Based on this proof, architectural topologies are utilized to quantify the suppression of local entropy decrease (SED) as a data-free and running-free proxy. Experimental results show that SED outperforms most state-of-the-art proxies in terms of architecture selection on five benchmarks, with computation time reduced by three orders of magnitude. We further compare the SED-based NAS with state-of-the-art proxies. SED-based NAS selects the architecture with higher accuracy and fewer parameters in only one second. The theoretical analyses of local entropy and experimental results demonstrate that the suppression of local entropy decrease facilitates selecting optimal architectures in Zero-Shot NAS.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06308v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent works demonstrate the effectiveness of diffusion models as unsupervised solvers for inverse imaging problems. Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) has greatly benefited from these advancements, achieving improved generalization without reliance on measurement parameters. However, this comes at the cost of potential hallucinations, especially when handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To ensure reliability, it is essential to study OOD detection for CT reconstruction across both clinical and industrial applications. This need further extends to enabling the OOD detector to function effectively as an anomaly inspection tool. In this paper, we explore the use of a diffusion model, trained to capture the target distribution for CT reconstruction, as an in-distribution prior. Building on recent research, we employ the model to reconstruct partially diffused input images and assess OOD-ness through multiple reconstruction errors. Adapting this approach for sparse-view CT requires redefining the notions of \"input\" and \"reconstruction error\". Here, we use filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstructions as input and investigate various definitions of reconstruction error. Our proof-of-concept experiments on the MNIST dataset highlight both successes and failures, demonstrating the potential and limitations of integrating such an OOD detector into a CT reconstruction system. Our findings suggest that effective OOD detection can be achieved by comparing measurements with forward-projected reconstructions, provided that reconstructions from noisy FBP inputs are conditioned on the measurements. However, conditioning can sometimes lead the OOD detector to inadvertently reconstruct OOD images well. To counter this, we introduce a weighting approach that improves robustness against highly informative OOD measurements, albeit with a trade-off in performance in certain cases.",

This paper introduces a novel algorithm for optimizing the BA model in the context of image sequence alignment for cryo-electron tomography, utilizing optimal control theory to directly optimize general nonlinear functions. The proposed Optimal Control Algorithm (OCA) exhibits superior convergence rates and effectively mitigates the oscillatory behavior frequently observed in L-M algorithm. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets were conducted to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The results demonstrate that the OCA achieves faster convergence compared to the L-M algorithm. Moreover, the incorporation of a bisection-based update procedure significantly enhances the OCA's performance, particularly in poorly initialized datasets. These findings indicate that the OCA can substantially improve the efficiency of 3D reconstructions in cryo-electron tomography.",

We investigate and compare the effects of activation compression using Singular Value Decomposition and its tensor variant, High-Order Singular Value Decomposition. The application of low-order decomposition results in considerable memory savings while preserving the features essential for learning, and also offers theoretical guarantees to convergence.

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables healthcare professionals and government authorities to break the chain of transition and flatten the epidemic curve. With the number of cases accelerating across the developed world, COVID-19 induced Viral Pneumonia cases is a big challenge. Overlapping of COVID-19 cases with Viral Pneumonia and other lung infections with limited dataset and long training hours is a serious problem to cater. Limited amount of data often results in over-fitting models and due to this reason, model does not predict generalized results. To fill this gap, we proposed GAN-based approach to synthesize images which later fed into the deep learning models to classify images of COVID-19, Normal, and Viral Pneumonia. Specifically, customized Wasserstein GAN is proposed to generate 19% more Chest X-ray images as compare to the real images. This expanded dataset is then used to train four proposed deep learning models: VGG-16, ResNet-50, GoogLeNet and MNAST. The result showed that expanded dataset utilized deep learning models to deliver high classification accuracies. In particular, VGG-16 achieved highest accuracy of 99.17% among all four proposed schemes.

Previous works mostly focus on generating stego-images with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and usually rely on pseudo-keys, namely conditions or parameters involved in the generation process, which are related to secret images.

To enhance sampling speed without sacrificing quality, various distillation-based accelerated sampling algorithms have been recently proposed. However, they typically require significant additional training costs and model parameter storage, which limit their practical application. In this work, we propose PCA-based Adaptive Search (PAS), which optimizes existing solvers for DPMs with minimal learnable parameters and training costs. Specifically, we first employ PCA to obtain a few orthogonal unit basis vectors to span the high-dimensional sampling space, which enables us to learn just a set of coordinates to correct the sampling direction; furthermore, based on the observation that the cumulative truncation error exhibits an ``S''-shape, we design an adaptive search strategy that further enhances the sampling efficiency and reduces the number of stored parameters to approximately 10. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAS can significantly enhance existing fast solvers in a plug-and-play manner with negligible costs. For instance, on CIFAR10, PAS requires only 12 parameters and less than 1 minute of training on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU to optimize the DDIM from 15.69 FID (NFE=10) to 4.37.",

Given this limitation, there has been a surge of interest in equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) that learns features to be augmentation-aware. However, even for the simplest rotation prediction method, there is a lack of rigorous understanding of why, when, and how E-SSL learns useful features for downstream tasks. To bridge this gap between practice and theory, we establish an information-theoretic perspective to understand the generalization ability of E-SSL. In particular, we identify a critical explaining-away effect in E-SSL that creates a synergy between the equivariant and classification tasks. This synergy effect encourages models to extract class-relevant features to improve its equivariant prediction, which, in turn, benefits downstream tasks requiring semantic features. Based on this perspective, we theoretically analyze the influence of data transformations and reveal several principles for practical designs of E-SSL. Our theory not only aligns well with existing E-SSL methods but also sheds light on new directions by exploring the benefits of model equivariance. We believe that a theoretically grounded understanding on the role of equivariance would inspire more principled and advanced designs in this field.

However, registering US images with only partially overlapping anatomical contents is a challenging task. In this work, we introduce SynStitch, a self-supervised framework designed for 2DUS stitching. SynStitch consists of a synthetic stitching pair generation module (SSPGM) and an image stitching module (ISM). SSPGM utilizes a patch-conditioned ControlNet to generate realistic 2DUS stitching pairs with known affine matrix from a single input image. ISM then utilizes this synthetic paired data to learn 2DUS stitching in a supervised manner. Our framework was evaluated against multiple leading methods on a kidney ultrasound dataset, demonstrating superior 2DUS stitching performance through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The code will be made public upon acceptance of the paper.",

However, neural-network approaches can unexpectedly introduce visual artifacts in some images. We therefore propose methods to separately detect three types of artifacts (texture and boundary degradation, color change, and text corruption), to localize the affected regions, and to quantify the artifact strength. We consider only those regions that exhibit distortion due solely to the neural compression but that a traditional codec recovers successfully at a comparable bitrate. We employed our methods to collect artifacts for the JPEG AI verification model with respect to HM-18.0, the H.265 reference software. We processed about 350,000 unique images from the Open Images dataset using different compression-quality parameters; the result is a dataset of 46,440 artifacts validated through crowd-sourced subjective assessment. Our proposed dataset and methods are valuable for testing neural-network-based image codecs, identifying bugs in these codecs, and enhancing their performance.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06842v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Fetal brain tissue segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial tool that supports the understanding of neurodevelopment, yet it faces challenges due to the heterogeneity of data coming from different scanners and settings, and due to data scarcity. Recent approaches based on domain randomization, like SynthSeg, have shown a great potential for single source domain generalization, by simulating images with randomized contrast and image resolution from the label maps. In this work, we investigate how to maximize the out-of-domain (OOD) generalization potential of SynthSeg-based methods in fetal brain MRI. Specifically, when studying data generation, we demonstrate that the simple Gaussian mixture models used in SynthSeg enable more robust OOD generalization than physics-informed generation methods. We also investigate how intensity clustering can help create more faithful synthetic images, and observe that it is key to achieving a non-trivial OOD generalization capability when few label classes are available. Finally, by combining for the first time SynthSeg with modern fine-tuning approaches based on weight averaging, we show that fine-tuning a model pre-trained on synthetic data on a few real image-segmentation pairs in a new domain can lead to improvements in the target domain, but also in other domains. We summarize our findings as five key recommendations that we believe can guide practitioners who would like to develop SynthSeg-based approaches in other organs or modalities.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called ReCL to slow down forgetting in CL. Our framework exploits an implicit bias of gradient-based neural networks due to which these converge to margin maximization points. Such convergence points allow us to reconstruct old data from previous tasks, which we then combine with the current training data. Our framework is flexible and can be applied on top of existing, state-of-the-art CL methods to slow down forgetting. We further demonstrate the performance gain from our framework across a large series of experiments, including different CL scenarios (class incremental, domain incremental, task incremental learning) different datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10), and different network architectures. Across all experiments, we find large performance gains through ReCL.

However, there is currently a shortage of pixel-wise annotated HSI data necessary for training deep learning (DL) models. Additionally, the number of HSI-based research studies remains limited, and in many cases, the advantages of HSI over traditional RGB imaging have not been conclusively demonstrated, particularly for specimens collected intraoperatively. To address these challenges we present a database consisted of 27 HSIs of hematoxylin-eosin stained frozen sections, collected from 14 patients with colon adenocarcinoma metastasized to the liver. It is aimed to validate pixel-wise classification for intraoperative tumor resection. The HSIs were acquired in the spectral range of 450 to 800 nm, with a resolution of 1 nm, resulting in images of 1384x1035 pixels. Pixel-wise annotations were performed by three pathologists. To overcome challenges such as experimental variability and the lack of annotated data, we combined label-propagation-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) with spectral-spatial features extracted by: the multiscale principle of relevant information (MPRI) method and tensor singular spectrum analysis method. Using only 1% of labeled pixels per class the SSL-MPRI method achieved a micro balanced accuracy (BACC) of 0.9313 and a micro F1-score of 0.9235 on the HSI dataset. The performance on corresponding RGB images was lower, with a micro BACC of 0.8809 and a micro F1-score of 0.8688. These improvements are statistically significant.

The existing active acoustic sensing-based approach for 3D human pose estimation implicitly assumes that the target user is positioned along a line between loudspeakers and a microphone. Because reflection and diffraction of sound by the human body cause subtle acoustic signal changes compared to sound obstruction, the existing model degrades its accuracy significantly when subjects deviate from this line, limiting its practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel method composed of a position discriminator and reverberation-resistant model. The former predicts the standing positions of subjects and applies adversarial learning to extract subject position-invariant features. The latter utilizes acoustic signals before the estimation target time as references to enhance robustness against the variations in sound arrival times due to diffraction and reflection.

However, video models are not grounded in the embodiment of an agent, and do not describe how to actuate the world to reach the visual states depicted in a video. To tackle this problem, current methods use a separate vision-based inverse dynamic model trained on embodiment-specific data to map image states to actions. Gathering data to train such a model is often expensive and challenging, and this model is limited to visual settings similar to the ones in which data are available. In this paper, we investigate how to directly ground video models to continuous actions through self-exploration in the embodied environment -- using generated video states as visual goals for exploration. We propose a framework that uses trajectory level action generation in combination with video guidance to enable an agent to solve complex tasks without any external supervision, e.g., rewards, action labels, or segmentation masks. We validate the proposed approach on 8 tasks in Libero, 6 tasks in MetaWorld, 4 tasks in Calvin, and 12 tasks in iThor Visual Navigation.

Nonetheless, certain challenges persist when integrating conventional erase-based masking within Siamese ConvNets. Two primary concerns are: (1) The continuous data processing nature of ConvNets, which doesn't allow for the exclusion of non-informative masked regions, leading to reduced training efficiency compared to ViT architecture; (2) The misalignment between erase-based masking and the contrastive-based objective, distinguishing it from the MIM technique. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel filling-based masking approach, termed \\textbf{MixMask}. The proposed method replaces erased areas with content from a different image, effectively countering the information depletion seen in traditional masking methods. Additionally, we unveil an adaptive loss function that captures the semantics of the newly patched views, ensuring seamless integration within the architectural framework. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments across various datasets and application scenarios. The findings underscore our framework's enhanced performance in areas such as linear probing, semi-supervised and supervised finetuning, object detection and segmentation.

In the existing FGVC datasets used in computer vision, it is generally assumed that each collected instance has fixed characteristics and the distribution of different categories is relatively balanced. In contrast, the real world scenario reveals the fact that the characteristics of instances tend to vary with time and exhibit a long-tailed distribution. Hence, the collected datasets may mislead the optimization of the fine-grained classifiers, resulting in unpleasant performance in real applications. Starting from the real-world conditions and to promote the practical progress of fine-grained visual categorization, we present a Concept Drift and Long-Tailed Distribution dataset. Specifically, the dataset is collected by gathering 11195 images of 250 instances in different species for 47 consecutive months in their natural contexts. The collection process involves dozens of crowd workers for photographing and domain experts for labeling.

However, existing MMIF methods lack the ability to resist different weather interferences in real-world scenes, preventing them from being useful in practical applications such as autonomous driving. To bridge this research gap, we proposed an all-weather MMIF model. Achieving effective multi-tasking in this context is particularly challenging due to the complex and diverse nature of weather conditions. A key obstacle lies in the 'black box' nature of current deep learning architectures, which restricts their multi-tasking capabilities. To overcome this, we decompose the network into two modules: a fusion module and a restoration module. For the fusion module, we introduce a learnable low-rank representation model to decompose images into low-rank and sparse components. This interpretable feature separation allows us to better observe and understand images. For the restoration module, we propose a physically-aware clear feature prediction module based on an atmospheric scattering model that can deduce variations in light transmittance from both scene illumination and reflectance. We also construct a large-scale multi-modality dataset with 100,000 image pairs across rain, haze, and snow conditions, covering various degradation levels and diverse scenes to thoroughly evaluate image fusion methods in adverse weather. Experimental results in both real-world and synthetic scenes show that the proposed algorithm excels in detail recovery and multi-modality feature extraction.

    "summary": "arXiv:2402.19197v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Pixel-aligned implicit models, such as PIFu, PIFuHD, and ICON, are used for single-view clothed human reconstruction. These models need to be trained using a sampling training scheme. Existing sampling training schemes either fail to capture thin surfaces (e.g. ears, fingers) or cause noisy artefacts in reconstructed meshes. To address these problems, we introduce Fine Structured-Aware Sampling (FSS), a new sampling training scheme to train pixel-aligned implicit models for single-view human reconstruction. FSS resolves the aforementioned problems by proactively adapting to the thickness and complexity of surfaces. In addition, unlike existing sampling training schemes, FSS shows how normals of sample points can be capitalized in the training process to improve results. Lastly, to further improve the training process, FSS proposes a mesh thickness loss signal for pixel-aligned implicit models. It becomes computationally feasible to introduce this loss once a slight reworking of the pixel-aligned implicit function framework is carried out. Our results show that our methods significantly outperform SOTA methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/kcyt/FSS.",

Currently, machine learning techniques have been extensively studied for automatically detecting deepfakes. However, human perception has been less explored. Malicious deepfakes could ultimately cause public and social problems. Can we humans correctly perceive the authenticity of the content of the videos we watch? The answer is obviously uncertain; therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the human ability to discern deepfake videos through a subjective study. We present our findings by comparing human observers to five state-ofthe-art audiovisual deepfake detection models. To this end, we used gamification concepts to provide 110 participants (55 native English speakers and 55 non-native English speakers) with a webbased platform where they could access a series of 40 videos (20 real and 20 fake) to determine their authenticity. Each participant performed the experiment twice with the same 40 videos in different random orders. The videos are manually selected from the FakeAVCeleb dataset. We found that all AI models performed better than humans when evaluated on the same 40 videos.

However, its strategy of blending optimization and adaptive density control might lead to sub-optimal results; it can sometimes yield noisy geometry and blurry artifacts due to prioritizing optimizing large Gaussians at the cost of adequately densifying smaller ones. To address this, we introduce AtomGS, consisting of Atomized Proliferation and Geometry-Guided Optimization. The Atomized Proliferation constrains ellipsoid Gaussians of various sizes into more uniform-sized Atom Gaussians. The strategy enhances the representation of areas with fine features by placing greater emphasis on densification in accordance with scene details. In addition, we proposed a Geometry-Guided Optimization approach that incorporates an Edge-Aware Normal Loss. This optimization method effectively smooths flat surfaces while preserving intricate details. Our evaluation shows that AtomGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality. Additionally, it achieves competitive accuracy in geometry reconstruction and offers a significant improvement in training speed over other SDF-based methods.

The advent of deep learning (DL) techniques has revolutionized this field by enabling autonomous feature extraction, significantly reducing the dependence on manual expertise. However, conventional DL models often rely solely on single data sources, failing to capture the full biological diversity of plant species comprehensively. Recent research has turned to multimodal learning to overcome this limitation by integrating multiple data types, which enriches the representation of plant characteristics. This shift introduces the challenge of determining the optimal point for modality fusion. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering multimodal DL-based approach for plant classification with automatic modality fusion. Utilizing the multimodal fusion architecture search, our method integrates images from multiple plant organs--flowers, leaves, fruits, and stems--into a cohesive model. Our method achieves 82.61% accuracy on 979 classes of the PlantCLEF2015 dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and outperforming late fusion by 10.33%.

While recent fully cross-frame self-attention mechanisms have improved character consistency across multiple frames, they come with high computational costs and often include redundant operations, especially for videos with higher frame rates. To address these inefficiencies, we propose an adaptive motion-guided cross-frame attention mechanism that selectively reduces redundant computations. This enables a greater number of cross-frame attentions over more frames within the same computational budget, thereby enhancing both video quality and temporal coherence. Our method leverages optical flow to focus on moving regions while sparsely attending to stationary areas, allowing for the joint editing of more frames without increasing computational demands. Traditional frame interpolation techniques struggle with motion blur and flickering in intermediate frames, which compromises visual fidelity. To mitigate this, we introduce KV-caching for jointly edited frames, reusing keys and values across intermediate frames to preserve visual quality and maintain temporal consistency throughout the video. With our adaptive cross-frame self-attention approach, we achieve a threefold increase in the number of keyframes processed compared to existing methods, all within the same computational budget as fully cross-frame attention baselines. This results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy and temporal consistency, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.

Alternatively, some methods explicitly decompose a scene into intrinsic components, such as normals and BRDFs, which can be inaccurate or under-expressive. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end 2D relighting diffusion model, called Neural Gaffer, that takes a single image of any object and can synthesize an accurate, high-quality relit image under any novel environmental lighting condition, simply by conditioning an image generator on a target environment map, without an explicit scene decomposition. Our method builds on a pre-trained diffusion model, and fine-tunes it on a synthetic relighting dataset, revealing and harnessing the inherent understanding of lighting present in the diffusion model. We evaluate our model on both synthetic and in-the-wild Internet imagery and demonstrate its advantages in terms of generalization and accuracy.

To bridge this gap, we present HOI-Swap, a novel diffusion-based video editing framework trained in a self-supervised manner. Designed in two stages, the first stage focuses on object swapping in a single frame with HOI awareness; the model learns to adjust the interaction patterns, such as the hand grasp, based on changes in the object's properties. The second stage extends the single-frame edit across the entire sequence; we achieve controllable motion alignment with the original video by: (1) warping a new sequence from the stage-I edited frame based on sampled motion points and (2) conditioning video generation on the warped sequence.

This prompts a crucial question: have VLMs effectively tackled the CR challenge? We conjecture that existing CR benchmarks may not adequately push the boundaries of modern VLMs due to the reliance on an LLM-only negative text generation pipeline. Consequently, the negatives produced either appear as outliers from the natural language distribution learned by VLMs' LLM decoders or as improbable within the corresponding image context. To address these limitations, we introduce ConMe -- a compositional reasoning benchmark and a novel data generation pipeline leveraging VLMs to produce `hard CR Q&A'. Through a new concept of VLMs conversing with each other to collaboratively expose their weaknesses, our pipeline autonomously generates, evaluates, and selects challenging compositional reasoning questions, establishing a robust CR benchmark, also subsequently validated manually.

In this work, we introduce Sketchpad, a framework that gives multimodal LMs a visual sketchpad and tools to draw on the sketchpad. The LM conducts planning and reasoning according to the visual artifacts it has drawn. Different from prior work, which uses text-to-image models to enable LMs to draw, Sketchpad enables LMs to draw with lines, boxes, marks, etc., which is closer to human sketching and better facilitates reasoning. Sketchpad can also use specialist vision models during the sketching process (e.g., draw bounding boxes with object detection models, draw masks with segmentation models), to further enhance visual perception and reasoning. We experiment with a wide range of math tasks (including geometry, functions, graphs, and chess) and complex visual reasoning tasks. Sketchpad substantially improves performance on all tasks over strong base models with no sketching, yielding an average gain of 12.7% on math tasks, and 8.6% on vision tasks.

At the same time, foundation models trained with internet-scale image and text data have demonstrated surprising world knowledge and reasoning ability for various downstream tasks. Utilizing these foundation models may help with human motion synthesis, which some recent works have superficially explored. However, these methods didn't fully unveil the foundation models' potential for this task and only support several simple actions and environments. In this paper, we for the first time, without any motion data, explore open-set human motion synthesis using natural language instructions as user control signals based on MLLMs across any motion task and environment. Our framework can be split into two stages: 1) sequential keyframe generation by utilizing MLLMs as a keyframe designer and animator; 2) motion filling between keyframes through interpolation and motion tracking.

Intuitive solutions include improving the size and quality of data or using larger foundation models. They show effectiveness in mitigating these issues, but at an expensive cost of collecting a vast amount of new data and introducing a significantly larger model. Standing at the intersection of these approaches, we examine the three object-oriented problems from the perspective of the image-to-text mapping process by the multimodal connector.

It classifies the semantic category of each LiDAR point and detects whether it is dynamic, a critical ability for tasks like obstacle avoidance and autonomous navigation. Existing approaches often rely on computationally heavy 4D convolutions or recursive networks, which result in poor real-time performance, making them unsuitable for online robotics and autonomous driving applications. In this paper, we introduce SegNet4D, a novel real-time 4D semantic segmentation network offering both efficiency and strong semantic understanding. SegNet4D addresses 4D segmentation as two tasks: single-scan semantic segmentation and moving object segmentation, each tackled by a separate network head. Both results are combined in a motion-semantic fusion module to achieve comprehensive 4D segmentation. Additionally, instance information is extracted from the current scan and exploited for instance-wise segmentation consistency. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art in both multi-scan semantic segmentation and moving object segmentation while offering greater efficiency, enabling real-time operation.

The recently proposed Slot Attention module, already leveraged by several derivative works for image segmentation and object tracking in videos, is a deep learning component which performs unsupervised object-centric scene decomposition on input images. It is based on an attention architecture, in which latent slot vectors, which hold compressed information on objects, attend to localized perceptual features from the input image. In this paper, we demonstrate that design decisions on normalizing the aggregated values in the attention architecture have considerable impact on the capabilities of Slot Attention to generalize to a higher number of slots and objects as seen during training. We propose and investigate alternatives to the original normalization scheme which increase the generalization capabilities of Slot Attention to varying slot and object counts, resulting in performance gains on the task of unsupervised image segmentation. The newly proposed normalizations represent minimal and easy to implement modifications of the usual Slot Attention module, changing the value aggregation mechanism from a weighted mean operation to a scaled weighted sum operation.",

To address this limitation, in this study, we introduce Generalizable Implicit Motion Modeling (GIMM), a novel and effective approach to motion modeling for VFI. Specifically, to enable GIMM as an effective motion modeling paradigm, we design a motion encoding pipeline to model spatiotemporal motion latent from bidirectional flows extracted from pre-trained flow estimators, effectively representing input-specific motion priors. Then, we implicitly predict arbitrary-timestep optical flows within two adjacent input frames via an adaptive coordinate-based neural network, with spatiotemporal coordinates and motion latent as inputs. Our GIMM can be easily integrated with existing flow-based VFI works by supplying accurately modeled motion. We show that GIMM performs better than the current state of the art on standard VFI benchmarks.",

Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.",

Our approach focuses on predicting the class and ordered point set of map instances within a scene, represented in the bird's eye view (BEV). Mask2Map consists of two primary components: the Instance-Level Mask Prediction Network (IMPNet) and the Mask-Driven Map Prediction Network (MMPNet). IMPNet generates Mask-Aware Queries and BEV Segmentation Masks to capture comprehensive semantic information globally. Subsequently, MMPNet enhances these query features using local contextual information through two submodules: the Positional Query Generator (PQG) and the Geometric Feature Extractor (GFE). PQG extracts instance-level positional queries by embedding BEV positional information into Mask-Aware Queries, while GFE utilizes BEV Segmentation Masks to generate point-level geometric features. However, we observed limited performance in Mask2Map due to inter-network inconsistency stemming from different predictions to Ground Truth (GT) matching between IMPNet and MMPNet. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Inter-network Denoising Training method, which guides the model to denoise the output affected by both noisy GT queries and perturbed GT Segmentation Masks. Our evaluation conducted on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrates that Mask2Map achieves remarkable performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods, with gains of 10.1% mAP and 4.1 mAP, respectively.

Although CLIP performs well, the typical direct latent feature alignment lacks clarity in its representation and similarity scores. On the other hand, lexical representation, a vector whose element represents the similarity between the sample and a word from the vocabulary, is a natural sparse representation and interpretable, providing exact matches for individual words. However, lexical representations are difficult to learn due to no ground-truth supervision and false-discovery issues, and thus requires complex design to train effectively. In this paper, we introduce LexVLA, a more interpretable VLA framework by learning a unified lexical representation for both modalities without complex design. We use DINOv2 as our visual model for its local-inclined features and Llama 2, a generative language model, to leverage its in-context lexical prediction ability. To avoid the false discovery, we propose an overuse penalty to refrain the lexical representation from falsely frequently activating meaningless words. We demonstrate that these two pre-trained uni-modal models can be well-aligned by fine-tuning on the modest multi-modal dataset and avoid intricate training configurations. On cross-modal retrieval benchmarks, LexVLA, trained on the CC-12M multi-modal dataset, outperforms baselines fine-tuned on larger datasets (e.g., YFCC15M) and those trained from scratch on even bigger datasets (e.g., 1.1B data, including CC-12M).

However, since SD is not specifically designed for human-oriented generation, these methods often require extensive fine-tuning on large-scale datasets, which renders them susceptible to overfitting and hinders their ability to personalize individuals with previously unseen styles. Moreover, these methods extensively focus on single-concept human image synthesis and lack the flexibility to customize individuals using multiple given concepts, thereby impeding their broader practical application. This paper proposes MagicFace, a novel training-free method for multi-concept universal-style human image personalized synthesis. Our core idea is to simulate how humans create images given specific concepts, i.e., first establish a semantic layout considering factors such as concepts' shape and posture, then optimize details by comparing with concepts at the pixel level. To implement this process, we introduce a coarse-to-fine generation pipeline, involving two sequential stages: semantic layout construction and concept feature injection. This is achieved by our Reference-aware Self-Attention (RSA) and Region-grouped Blend Attention (RBA) mechanisms. In the first stage, RSA enables the latent image to query features from all reference concepts simultaneously, extracting the overall semantic understanding to facilitate the initial semantic layout establishment. In the second stage, we employ an attention-based semantic segmentation method to pinpoint the latent generated regions of all concepts at each step. Following this, RBA divides the pixels of the latent image into semantic groups, with each group querying fine-grained features from the corresponding reference concept. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our MagicFace.",

To address these challenges, we meticulously collect a novel dataset, called PmLR50, consisting of 25,037 video frames covering various surgical phases from 50 laparoscopic liver resection procedures. Additionally, we develop an online baseline for PmLR50, termed PmNet.

Lidar captures 3D scene geometry by emitting pulses of light to a target and recording the speed-of-light time delay of the reflected light. However, conventional lidar systems do not output the raw, captured waveforms of backscattered light; instead, they pre-process these data into a 3D point cloud. Since this procedure typically does not accurately model the noise statistics of the system, exploit spatial priors, or incorporate information about downstream tasks, it ultimately discards useful information that is encoded in raw measurements of backscattered light. Here, we propose to leverage raw measurements captured with a single-photon lidar system from multiple viewpoints to optimize a neural surface representation of a scene. The measurements consist of time-resolved photon count histograms, or transients, which capture information about backscattered light at picosecond time scales. Additionally, we develop new regularization strategies that improve robustness to photon noise, enabling accurate surface reconstruction with as few as 10 photons per pixel.

Our approach combines unsupervised and supervised self-expertise strategies to refine the model's discernment and generalization. Initially, hierarchical pseudo-labeling is used to provide `soft supervision', improving the effectiveness of self-expertise. Our supervised technique differs from traditional methods by utilizing more abstract positive and negative samples, aiding in the formation of clusters that can generalize to novel categories.

Traditionally, anomaly detection has relied on human inspectors. However, 3D point clouds have gained attention due to their robustness to environmental factors and their ability to represent geometric data. Existing 3D anomaly detection methods generally fall into two categories. One compares scanned 3D point clouds with design files, assuming these files are always available. However, such assumptions are often violated in many real-world applications where model-free products exist, such as fresh produce (i.e., ``Cookie\", ``Potato\", etc.), dentures, bone, etc. The other category compares patches of scanned 3D point clouds with a library of normal patches named memory bank. However, those methods usually fail to detect incomplete shapes, which is a fairly common defect type (i.e., missing pieces of different products). The main challenge is that missing areas in 3D point clouds represent the absence of scanned points. This makes it infeasible to compare the missing region with existing point cloud patches in the memory bank. To address these two challenges, we proposed a unified, unsupervised 3D anomaly detection framework capable of identifying all types of defects on model-free products. Our method integrates two detection modules: a feature-based detection module and a reconstruction-based detection module. Feature-based detection covers geometric defects, such as dents, holes, and cracks, while the reconstruction-based method detects missing regions. Additionally, we employ a One-class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to fuse the detection results from both modules. The results demonstrate that (1) our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in identifying incomplete shapes and (2) it still maintains comparable performance with the SOTA methods in detecting all other types of anomalies.",

In this paper, we propose uncertainty-aware conditional NeRF for novel view synthesis to tackle the severe shape-radiance ambiguity from sparse surgical views. The core of UC-NeRF is to incorporate the multi-view uncertainty estimation to condition the neural radiance field for modeling the severe photometric inconsistencies adaptively.

    "summary": "arXiv:2409.16209v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Millimeter wave sensing provides people with the capability of sensing the surrounding crowds in a non-invasive and privacy-preserving manner, which holds huge application potential. However, detecting stationary crowds remains challenging due to several factors such as minimal movements (like breathing or casual fidgets), which can be easily treated as noise clusters during data collection and consequently filtered in the following processing procedures. Additionally, the uneven distribution of signal power due to signal power attenuation and interferences resulting from external reflectors or absorbers further complicates accurate detection. To address these challenges and enable stationary crowd detection across various application scenarios requiring specialized domain adaption, we introduce LLMCount, the first system to harness the capabilities of large-language models (LLMs) to enhance crowd detection performance. By exploiting the decision-making capability of LLM, we can successfully compensate the signal power to acquire a uniform distribution and thereby achieve a detection with higher accuracy. To assess the system's performance, comprehensive evaluations are conducted under diversified scenarios like hall, meeting room, and cinema. The evaluation results show that our proposed approach reaches high detection accuracy with lower overall latency compared with previous methods.",

Diagnosing and debiasing datasets is thus a necessity to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we present ConBias, a novel framework for diagnosing and mitigating Concept co-occurrence Biases in visual datasets. ConBias represents visual datasets as knowledge graphs of concepts, enabling meticulous analysis of spurious concept co-occurrences to uncover concept imbalances across the whole dataset. Moreover, we show that by employing a novel clique-based concept balancing strategy, we can mitigate these imbalances, leading to enhanced performance on downstream tasks.

However, creating an effective teaser for long videos is challenging for it requires long-range multimodal modeling on the input videos, while necessitating maintaining audiovisual alignments, managing scene changes and preserving factual accuracy for the output teasers. Due to the lack of a publicly-available dataset, progress along this research direction has been hindered. In this work, we present DocumentaryNet, a collection of 1,269 documentaries paired with their teasers, featuring multimodal data streams of video, speech, music, sound effects and narrations. With DocumentaryNet, we propose a new two-stage system for generating teasers from long documentaries. The proposed TeaserGen system first generates the teaser narration from the transcribed narration of the documentary using a pretrained large language model, and then selects the most relevant visual content to accompany the generated narration through language-vision models. For narration-video matching, we explore two approaches: a pretraining-based model using pretrained contrastive language-vision models and a deep sequential model that learns the mapping between the narrations and visuals.

Within any single domain, actions can often appear quite similar, making it challenging for deep models to distinguish them accurately. To evaluate the effectiveness of multimodal foundation models in helping us recognize such actions, we present ActionAtlas v1.0, a multiple-choice video question answering benchmark featuring short videos across various sports. Each video in the dataset is paired with a question and four or five choices. The question pinpoints specific individuals, asking which choice \"best\" describes their action within a certain temporal context. Overall, the dataset includes 934 videos showcasing 580 unique actions across 56 sports, with a total of 1896 actions within choices. Unlike most existing video question answering benchmarks that only cover simplistic actions, often identifiable from a single frame, ActionAtlas focuses on intricate movements and rigorously tests the model's capability to discern subtle differences between moves that look similar within each domain. We evaluate open and proprietary foundation models on this benchmark, finding that the best model, GPT-4o, achieves a maximum accuracy of 45.52%. Meanwhile, Non-expert crowd workers, provided with action description for each choice, achieve 61.64% accuracy, where random chance is approximately 21%. Our findings with state-of-the-art models indicate that having a high frame sampling rate is important for accurately recognizing actions in ActionAtlas, a feature that some leading proprietary video models, such as Gemini, do not include in their default configuration.",

Given an audio and image pair of a sounding event, this task aims at generating new audio-visual content by editing the given sounding event conditioned on the language guidance. For instance, we can alter the background environment of a sounding object while keeping its appearance unchanged, or we can add new sounds contextualized to the visual content. To address this task, we propose a new diffusion-based framework for joint audio-visual editing and introduce two key ideas. Firstly, we propose a one-shot adaptation approach to tailor generative diffusion models for audio-visual content editing. With as few as one audio-visual sample, we jointly transfer the audio and vision diffusion models to the target domain. After fine-tuning, our model enables consistent generation of this audio-visual sample. Secondly, we introduce a cross-modal semantic enhancement approach. We observe that when using language as content editing guidance, the vision branch may overlook editing requirements. This phenomenon, termed catastrophic neglect, hampers audio-visual alignment during content editing. We therefore enhance semantic consistency between language and vision to mitigate this issue. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method in language-based audio-visual editing and highlight its superiority over several baseline approaches.

Existing autoencoder models have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet 512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.

Despite recent advances in computer vision, automated analysis of primate behavior remains challenging due to the complexity of their social interactions and the lack of specialized algorithms. Existing methods often struggle with the nuanced behaviors and frequent occlusions characteristic of primate social dynamics. This study aims to develop an effective method for automated detection, tracking, and recognition of chimpanzee behaviors in video footage. Here we show that our proposed method, AlphaChimp, an end-to-end approach that simultaneously detects chimpanzee positions and estimates behavior categories from videos, significantly outperforms existing methods in behavior recognition. AlphaChimp achieves approximately 10% higher tracking accuracy and a 20% improvement in behavior recognition compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly excelling in the recognition of social behaviors. This superior performance stems from AlphaChimp's innovative architecture, which integrates temporal feature fusion with a Transformer-based self-attention mechanism, enabling more effective capture and interpretation of complex social interactions among chimpanzees. Our approach bridges the gap between computer vision and primatology, enhancing technical capabilities and deepening our understanding of primate communication and sociality.

To date, most of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas the requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually evolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the face of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging capabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl inStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned domain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental configurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a rehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To circumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze LVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to facilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings can be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment embeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up a low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the relevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2) contextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across tasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are aggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual instruction tuning process.",

We present PocoLoco -- the first template-free, point-based, pose-conditioned generative model for 3D humans in loose clothing. We motivate our work by noting that most methods require a parametric model of the human body to ground pose-dependent deformations. Consequently, they are restricted to modeling clothing that is topologically similar to the naked body and do not extend well to loose clothing. The few methods that attempt to model loose clothing typically require either canonicalization or a UV-parameterization and need to address the challenging problem of explicitly estimating correspondences for the deforming clothes. In this work, we formulate avatar clothing deformation as a conditional point-cloud generation task within the denoising diffusion framework. Crucially, our framework operates directly on unordered point clouds, eliminating the need for a parametric model or a clothing template. This also enables a variety of practical applications, such as point-cloud completion and pose-based editing -- important features for virtual human animation. As current datasets for human avatars in loose clothing are far too small for training diffusion models, we release a dataset of two subjects performing various poses in loose clothing with a total of 75K point clouds.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.04332v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Generative text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated a remarkable ability to generate diverse, high-quality images. However, they are surprisingly inept when it comes to rendering human hands, which are often anatomically incorrect or reside in the \"uncanny valley\". In this paper, we propose a method HandCraft for restoring such malformed hands. This is achieved by automatically constructing masks and depth images for hands as conditioning signals using a parametric model, allowing a diffusion-based image editor to fix the hand's anatomy and adjust its pose while seamlessly integrating the changes into the original image, preserving pose, color, and style. Our plug-and-play hand restoration solution is compatible with existing pretrained diffusion models, and the restoration process facilitates adoption by eschewing any fine-tuning or training requirements for the diffusion models. We also contribute MalHand datasets that contain generated images with a wide variety of malformed hands in several styles for hand detector training and hand restoration benchmarking, and demonstrate through qualitative and quantitative evaluation that HandCraft not only restores anatomical correctness but also maintains the integrity of the overall image.",

Realizing the LoFG, we present to date the largest semantic 3D facade segmentation dataset, providing 601 million annotated points at five and 15 classes of LoFG2 and LoFG3, respectively. Moreover, we analyze the performance of baseline semantic segmentation methods on our introduced LoFG classes and data, complementing it with a discussion on the unresolved challenges for facade segmentation.

However, automating storytelling video production, particularly for customized narratives, remains challenging due to the complexity of maintaining subject consistency across shots. While existing approaches like Mora and AesopAgent integrate multiple agents for Story-to-Video (S2V) generation, they fall short in preserving protagonist consistency and supporting Customized Storytelling Video Generation (CSVG). To address these limitations, we propose StoryAgent, a multi-agent framework designed for CSVG. StoryAgent decomposes CSVG into distinct subtasks assigned to specialized agents, mirroring the professional production process. Notably, our framework includes agents for story design, storyboard generation, video creation, agent coordination, and result evaluation. Leveraging the strengths of different models, StoryAgent enhances control over the generation process, significantly improving character consistency. Specifically, we introduce a customized Image-to-Video (I2V) method, LoRA-BE, to enhance intra-shot temporal consistency, while a novel storyboard generation pipeline is proposed to maintain subject consistency across shots. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in synthesizing highly consistent storytelling videos, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of StoryAgent, a versatile framework for video generation tasks, and novel techniques for preserving protagonist consistency.",

Recent studies have shown that in zero-shot classification tasks, descriptors incorporating additional cues, high-level concepts, or even random characters often outperform those using only the category name. In many classification tasks, while the top-1 accuracy may be relatively low, the top-5 accuracy is often significantly higher. This gap implies that most misclassifications occur among a few similar classes, highlighting the model's difficulty in distinguishing between classes with subtle differences. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel concept of comparative descriptors. These descriptors emphasize the unique features of a target class against its most similar classes, enhancing differentiation. By generating and integrating these comparative descriptors into the classification framework, we refine the semantic focus and improve classification accuracy. An additional filtering process ensures that these descriptors are closer to the image embeddings in the CLIP space, further enhancing performance. Our approach demonstrates improved accuracy and robustness in visual classification tasks by addressing the specific challenge of subtle inter-class differences.",

A patient will have better prognosis when he has achieved a pathological complete response (pCR) with the treatment of NAC. There has been a trend to directly predict pCR to NAC from histological images based on deep learning (DL). However, the DL-based predictive models numerically have better performances in internal validation than in external validation. In this paper, we aim to alleviate this situation with an intrinsic approach. We propose an experts' cognition-driven ensemble deep learning (ECDEDL) approach. Taking the cognition of both pathology and artificial intelligence experts into consideration to improve the generalization of the predictive model to the external validation, ECDEDL can intrinsically approximate the working paradigm of a human being which will refer to his various working experiences to make decisions. ECDEDL was validated with 695 WSIs collected from the same center as the primary dataset to develop the predictive model and perform the internal validation, and was also validated with 340 WSIs collected from other three centers as the external dataset to perform the external validation. In external validation, ECDEDL improves the AUCs of pCR prediction from 61.52(59.80-63.26) to 67.75(66.74-68.80) and the Accuracies of pCR prediction from 56.09(49.39-62.79) to 71.01(69.44-72.58).

Randomized smoothing is a powerful framework for making models provably robust against small changes to their inputs - by guaranteeing robustness of the majority vote when randomly adding noise before classification. Yet, certifying robustness on such complex data via randomized smoothing is challenging when adversaries do not arbitrarily perturb entire objects (e.g. images) but only a subset of their entities (e.g. pixels). As a solution, we introduce hierarchical randomized smoothing: We partially smooth objects by adding random noise only on a randomly selected subset of their entities. By adding noise in a more targeted manner than existing methods we obtain stronger robustness guarantees while maintaining high accuracy. We initialize hierarchical smoothing using different noising distributions, yielding novel robustness certificates for discrete and continuous domains. We experimentally demonstrate the importance of hierarchical smoothing in image and node classification, where it yields superior robustness-accuracy trade-offs. Overall, hierarchical smoothing is an important contribution towards models that are both - certifiably robust to perturbations and accurate.",

Central to these algorithms is the diffusion process, a set of equations which maps data to noise in a way that can significantly affect performance. In this paper, we explore whether the diffusion process can be learned from data. Our work is grounded in Bayesian inference and seeks to improve log-likelihood estimation by casting the learned diffusion process as an approximate variational posterior that yields a tighter lower bound (ELBO) on the likelihood. A widely held assumption is that the ELBO is invariant to the noise process: our work dispels this assumption and proposes multivariate learned adaptive noise (MULAN), a learned diffusion process that applies noise at different rates across an image. Specifically, our method relies on a multivariate noise schedule that is a function of the data to ensure that the ELBO is no longer invariant to the choice of the noise schedule as in previous works. Empirically, MULAN sets a new state-of-the-art in density estimation on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet and reduces the number of training steps by 50%.

This issue is evidenced by low error rates on the meta-training tasks, but high error rates on new tasks. However, there can be a number of novel solutions to this problem keeping in mind any of the two objectives to be attained, i.e. to increase diversity in the tasks and to reduce the confidence of the model for some of the tasks. In light of the above, this paper proposes a number of solutions to tackle meta-overfitting on few-shot learning settings, such as few-shot sinusoid regression and few shot classification.

This paper proposes an open platform GenAI-Arena to evaluate different image and video generative models, where users can actively participate in evaluating these models. By leveraging collective user feedback and votes, GenAI-Arena aims to provide a more democratic and accurate measure of model performance. It covers three tasks of text-to-image generation, text-to-video generation, and image editing respectively. Currently, we cover a total of 35 open-source generative models. GenAI-Arena has been operating for seven months, amassing over 9000 votes from the community. We describe our platform, analyze the data, and explain the statistical methods for ranking the models. To further promote the research in building model-based evaluation metrics, we release a cleaned version of our preference data for the three tasks, namely GenAI-Bench. We prompt the existing multi-modal models like Gemini, and GPT-4o to mimic human voting. We compute the accuracy by comparing the model voting with the human voting to understand their judging abilities. Our results show existing multimodal models are still lagging in assessing the generated visual content, even the best model GPT-4o only achieves an average accuracy of 49.19 across the three generative tasks. Open-source MLLMs perform even worse due to the lack of instruction-following and reasoning ability in complex vision scenarios.",

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have traditionally been used for this task but have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformers, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, aim to address this problem.

Then, for reconstructions on the ground, to deal with the feature extraction ability degradation due to simplifying encoders, we propose a diffusion-based model to compensate image details when decoding. Our insight is that satellite's earth observation photos are not just images but indeed multi-modal data with a nature of Text-to-Image pairing since they are collected with rich sensor data (e.g. coordinates, timestamp, etc.) that can be used as the condition for diffusion generation. Extensive experiments show that COSMIC outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both perceptual and distortion metrics.",

    "title": "Efficient Perspective-Correct 3D Gaussian Splatting Using Hybrid Transparency",
    "summary": "arXiv:2410.08129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGS) have proven a versatile rendering primitive, both for inverse rendering as well as real-time exploration of scenes. In these applications, coherence across camera frames and multiple views is crucial, be it for robust convergence of a scene reconstruction or for artifact-free fly-throughs. Recent work started mitigating artifacts that break multi-view coherence, including popping artifacts due to inconsistent transparency sorting and perspective-correct outlines of (2D) splats. At the same time, real-time requirements forced such implementations to accept compromises in how transparency of large assemblies of 3D Gaussians is resolved, in turn breaking coherence in other ways. In our work, we aim at achieving maximum coherence, by rendering fully perspective-correct 3D Gaussians while using a high-quality approximation of accurate blending, hybrid transparency, on a per-pixel level, in order to retain real-time frame rates. Our fast and perspectively accurate approach for evaluation of 3D Gaussians does not require matrix inversions, thereby ensuring numerical stability and eliminating the need for special handling of degenerate splats, and the hybrid transparency formulation for blending maintains similar quality as fully resolved per-pixel transparencies at a fraction of the rendering costs. We further show that each of these two components can be independently integrated into Gaussian splatting systems. In combination, they achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher frame rates, 2$\\times$ faster optimization, and equal or better image quality with fewer rendering artifacts compared to traditional 3DGS on common benchmarks.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2410.18456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Accurate and complete segmentation of airways in chest CT images is essential for the quantitative assessment of lung diseases and the facilitation of pulmonary interventional procedures. Although deep learning has led to significant advancements in medical image segmentation, maintaining airway continuity remains particularly challenging. This difficulty arises primarily from the small and dispersed nature of airway structures, as well as class imbalance in CT scans. To address these challenges, we designed a Multi-scale Nested Residual U-Net (MNR-UNet), incorporating multi-scale inputs and Residual Multi-scale Modules (RMM) into a nested residual framework to enhance information flow, effectively capturing the intricate details of small airways and mitigating gradient vanishing. Building on this, we developed a three-stage segmentation pipeline to optimize the training of the MNR-UNet. The first two stages prioritize high accuracy and sensitivity, while the third stage focuses on repairing airway breakages to balance topological completeness and correctness. To further address class imbalance, we introduced a weighted Breakage-Aware Loss (wBAL) to heighten focus on challenging samples, penalizing breakages and thereby extending the length of the airway tree. Additionally, we proposed a hierarchical evaluation framework to offer more clinically meaningful analysis. Validation on both in-house and public datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves superior performance in detecting more accurate airway voxels and identifying additional branches, significantly improving airway topological completeness. The code will be released publicly following the publication of the paper.",

Existing code completion benchmarks often overlook this dynamic aspect, and the one that does consider it relies on static code prediction tasks without execution-based evaluation, offering a limited perspective on a model's practical usability. To address this gap, we introduce \\GitChameleon{}, a novel, manually curated dataset comprising 116 Python code completion problems, each conditioned on specific library versions and accompanied by executable unit tests.  is designed to rigorously assess the ability of modern large language models (LLMs) to generate version-specific code that is not only syntactically correct but also functionally accurate upon execution. Our comprehensive evaluations reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task; for instance, GPT-4o achieves a pass@10 of only 39.9\\% (43.7\\% when provided with error feedback), highlighting the complexity of the problem and the limitations of current models. By providing an execution-based benchmark that emphasizes the dynamic nature of code libraries,  serves as a critical tool to advance the development of more adaptable and reliable code generation models.

The answer would lie in learning dataset-specific features and digesting their knowledge in a single model. Previous methods achieve this by having separate correction language models, resulting in a significant increase in parameters. In this work, we present Mixture-of-Experts as a solution, highlighting that MoEs are much more than a scalability tool. We propose a Multi-Task Correction MoE, where we train the experts to become an ``expert'' of speech-to-text, language-to-text and vision-to-text datasets by learning to route each dataset's tokens to its mapped expert. Experiments on the Open ASR Leaderboard show that we explore a new state-of-the-art performance by achieving an average relative 5.0% WER reduction and substantial improvements in BLEU scores for speech and translation tasks. On zero-shot evaluation, NeKo outperforms GPT-3.5 and Claude-Opus with 15.5% to 27.6% relative WER reduction in the Hyporadise benchmark.

This restricts applications in real-world scenarios where parts of the image may come from different sources or have been edited. We introduce a deep-learning model for localized image watermarking, dubbed the Watermark Anything Model (WAM). The WAM embedder imperceptibly modifies the input image, while the extractor segments the received image into watermarked and non-watermarked areas and recovers one or several hidden messages from the areas found to be watermarked. The models are jointly trained at low resolution and without perceptual constraints, then post-trained for imperceptibility and multiple watermarks. Experiments show that WAM is competitive with state-of-the art methods in terms of imperceptibility and robustness, especially against inpainting and splicing, even on high-resolution images. Moreover, it offers new capabilities: WAM can locate watermarked areas in spliced images and extract distinct 32-bit messages with less than 1 bit error from multiple small regions - no larger than 10% of the image surface - even for small 256times 256 images.",

    "summary": "Safety fine-tuning algorithms are commonly used to fine-tune language models to reduce harmful outputs, but the exact internal mechanisms of how those models achieve this remain unclear. In studying direct preference optimisation (DPO) for toxicity reduction, current explanations claim that DPO works by dampening the most toxic MLP neurons to learn an offset to avert toxic regions in the residual stream. However, by ablating the most toxic neurons and applying activation patching, we find this explanation incomplete. By projecting neuron activation changes onto a toxicity probe, we find that only 31.8\\% of toxicity reduction comes from dampened toxic neurons. Instead, DPO reduces toxicity by accumulating effects across multiple neuron groups, both reducing writing in the toxic direction and promoting anti-toxicity in the residual stream. Moreover, DPO gives noisy adjustments to neuron activations, with many neurons actually increasing toxicity. This indicates that DPO is a balancing process between opposing neuron effects to achieve toxicity reduction.",

    "title": "KMM: Key Frame Mask Mamba for Extended Motion Generation",
    "summary": "Human motion generation is a cut-edge area of research in generative computer vision, with promising applications in video creation, game development, and robotic manipulation. The recent Mamba architecture shows promising results in efficiently modeling long and complex sequences, yet two significant challenges remain: Firstly, directly applying Mamba to extended motion generation is ineffective, as the limited capacity of the implicit memory leads to memory decay. Secondly, Mamba struggles with multimodal fusion compared to Transformers, and lack alignment with textual queries, often confusing directions (left or right) or omitting parts of longer text queries. To address these challenges, our paper presents three key contributions: Firstly, we introduce KMM, a novel architecture featuring Key frame Masking Modeling, designed to enhance Mamba's focus on key actions in motion segments. This approach addresses the memory decay problem and represents a pioneering method in customizing strategic frame-level masking in SSMs. Additionally, we designed a contrastive learning paradigm for addressing the multimodal fusion problem in Mamba and improving the motion-text alignment. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on the go-to dataset, BABEL, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a reduction of more than 57% in FID and 70% parameters compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.

We introduce Add-it, a training-free approach that extends diffusion models' attention mechanisms to incorporate information from three key sources: the scene image, the text prompt, and the generated image itself. Our weighted extended-attention mechanism maintains structural consistency and fine details while ensuring natural object placement. Without task-specific fine-tuning, Add-it achieves state-of-the-art results on both real and generated image insertion benchmarks, including our newly constructed \"Additing Affordance Benchmark\" for evaluating object placement plausibility, outperforming supervised methods. Human evaluations show that Add-it is preferred in over 80% of cases, and it also demonstrates improvements in various automated metrics.",

    "title": "Game-theoretic LLM: Agent Workflow for Negotiation Games",
    "summary": "This paper investigates the rationality of large language models (LLMs) in strategic decision-making contexts, specifically within the framework of game theory. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs across a spectrum of complete-information and incomplete-information games. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently deviate from rational strategies, particularly as the complexity of the game increases with larger payoff matrices or deeper sequential trees.   To address these limitations, we design multiple game-theoretic workflows that guide the reasoning and decision-making processes of LLMs. These workflows aim to enhance the models' ability to compute Nash Equilibria and make rational choices, even under conditions of uncertainty and incomplete information. Experimental results demonstrate that the adoption of these workflows significantly improves the rationality and robustness of LLMs in game-theoretic tasks. Specifically, with the workflow, LLMs exhibit marked improvements in identifying optimal strategies, achieving near-optimal allocations in negotiation scenarios, and reducing susceptibility to exploitation during negotiations. Furthermore, we explore the meta-strategic considerations of whether it is rational for agents to adopt such workflows, recognizing that the decision to use or forgo the workflow constitutes a game-theoretic issue in itself.   Our research contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' decision-making capabilities in strategic contexts and provides insights into enhancing their rationality through structured workflows. The findings have implications for the development of more robust and strategically sound AI agents capable of navigating complex interactive environments.

    "summary": "Instruction-guided image editing methods have demonstrated significant potential by training diffusion models on automatically synthesized or manually annotated image editing pairs. However, these methods remain far from practical, real-life applications. We identify three primary challenges contributing to this gap. Firstly, existing models have limited editing skills due to the biased synthesis process. Secondly, these methods are trained with datasets with a high volume of noise and artifacts. This is due to the application of simple filtering methods like CLIP-score. Thirdly, all these datasets are restricted to a single low resolution and fixed aspect ratio, limiting the versatility to handle real-world use cases. In this paper, we present \\omniedit, which is an omnipotent editor to handle seven different image editing tasks with any aspect ratio seamlessly. Our contribution is in four folds: (1) \\omniedit is trained by utilizing the supervision from seven different specialist models to ensure task coverage. (2) we utilize importance sampling based on the scores provided by large multimodal models (like GPT-4o) instead of CLIP-score to improve the data quality. (3) we propose a new editing architecture called EditNet to greatly boost the editing success rate, (4) we provide images with different aspect ratios to ensure that our model can handle any image in the wild. We have curated a test set containing images of different aspect ratios, accompanied by diverse instructions to cover different tasks. Both automatic evaluation and human evaluations demonstrate that \\omniedit can significantly outperform all the existing models.

To this end, this paper introduces TRACE, a benchmark for improving and evaluating the complex instructionfollowing ability, which consists of 120K training data and 1K evaluation data. Furthermore, we propose IOPO (Input-Output Preference Optimization) alignment method which takes both input and output preference pairs into consideration, where LLMs not only rapidly align with response preferences but also meticulously explore the instruction preferences. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and outof-domain datasets confirm the effectiveness of IOPO, showing 8.15%, 2.18% improvements on in-domain data and 6.29%, 3.13% on outof-domain data compared to SFT and DPO respectively.",

    "summary": "Understanding and manipulating the causal generation mechanisms in language models is essential for controlling their behavior. Previous work has primarily relied on techniques such as representation surgery -- e.g., model ablations or manipulation of linear subspaces tied to specific concepts -- to intervene on these models. To understand the impact of interventions precisely, it is useful to examine counterfactuals -- e.g., how a given sentence would have appeared had it been generated by the model following a specific intervention. We highlight that counterfactual reasoning is conceptually distinct from interventions, as articulated in Pearl's causal hierarchy. Based on this observation, we propose a framework for generating true string counterfactuals by reformulating language models as Generalized Structural-equation. Models using the Gumbel-max trick. This allows us to model the joint distribution over original strings and their counterfactuals resulting from the same instantiation of the sampling noise. We develop an algorithm based on hindsight Gumbel sampling that allows us to infer the latent noise variables and generate counterfactuals of observed strings. Our experiments demonstrate that the approach produces meaningful counterfactuals while at the same time showing that commonly used intervention techniques have considerable undesired side effects.",

To our knowledge, our training framework is the first to directly address the retrieval setting for multimodal long documents. To enable tuning open-source models, we construct a training corpus in a fully automatic manner for the question-answering task over such documents. Experiments show that our tuning approach achieves a relative improvement of 4.6% for the correctness of model responses, compared to the baseline open-source models.

However, existing finance benchmarks often suffer from limited language and task coverage, as well as challenges such as low-quality datasets and inadequate adaptability for LLM evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose \"Golden Touchstone\", the first comprehensive bilingual benchmark for financial LLMs, which incorporates representative datasets from both Chinese and English across eight core financial NLP tasks. Developed from extensive open source data collection and industry-specific demands, this benchmark includes a variety of financial tasks aimed at thoroughly assessing models' language understanding and generation capabilities. Through comparative analysis of major models on the benchmark, such as GPT-4o Llama3, FinGPT and FinMA, we reveal their strengths and limitations in processing complex financial information. Additionally, we open-sourced Touchstone-GPT, a financial LLM trained through continual pre-training and financial instruction tuning, which demonstrates strong performance on the bilingual benchmark but still has limitations in specific tasks.This research not only provides the financial large language models with a practical evaluation tool but also guides the development and optimization of future research.
