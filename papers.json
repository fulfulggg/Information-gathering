    "title": "Vision Transformers on the Edge: A Comprehensive Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration Strategies",
    "summary": "arXiv:2503.02891v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: In recent years, vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as powerful and promising techniques for computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Unlike convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which rely on hierarchical feature extraction, ViTs treat images as sequences of patches and leverage self-attention mechanisms. However, their high computational complexity and memory demands pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, extensive research has focused on model compression techniques and hardware-aware acceleration strategies. Nonetheless, a comprehensive review that systematically categorizes these techniques and their trade-offs in accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability for edge deployment remains lacking. This survey bridges this gap by providing a structured analysis of model compression techniques, software tools for inference on edge, and hardware acceleration strategies for ViTs. We discuss their impact on accuracy, efficiency, and hardware adaptability, highlighting key challenges and emerging research directions to advance ViT deployment on edge platforms, including graphics processing units (GPUs), tensor processing units (TPUs), and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). The goal is to inspire further research with a contemporary guide on optimizing ViTs for efficient deployment on edge devices.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.02897v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: High-quality annotations are essential for object detection models, but ensuring label accuracy - especially for bounding boxes - remains both challenging and costly. This paper introduces ClipGrader, a novel approach that leverages vision-language models to automatically assess the accuracy of bounding box annotations. By adapting CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) to evaluate both class label correctness and spatial precision of bounding box, ClipGrader offers an effective solution for grading object detection labels. Tested on modified object detection datasets with artificially disturbed bounding boxes, ClipGrader achieves 91% accuracy on COCO with a 1.8% false positive rate. Moreover, it maintains 87% accuracy with a 2.1% false positive rate when trained on just 10% of the COCO data. ClipGrader also scales effectively to larger datasets such as LVIS, achieving 79% accuracy across 1,203 classes. Our experiments demonstrate ClipGrader's ability to identify errors in existing COCO annotations, highlighting its potential for dataset refinement. When integrated into a semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) model, ClipGrader readily improves the pseudo label quality, helping achieve higher mAP (mean Average Precision) throughout the training process. ClipGrader thus provides a scalable AI-assisted tool for enhancing annotation quality control and verifying annotations in large-scale object detection datasets.",

These methods are vulnerable to fierce camera ego-motion, resulting in inaccurate person localization. We consider person localization as a part of a pose estimation problem. By representing a human with a four-point model, our method jointly estimates the 2D camera attitude and the person's 3D location through optimization.

In this paper, we introduce a Contrastive Co-Transformer framework, which is simple and fast, yet able to improve the performance by a large margin compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. We argue the robustness of transformers when dealing with label noise. Our Contrastive Co-Transformer approach is able to utilize all samples in the dataset, irrespective of whether they are clean or noisy.

However, its large storage requirements and high computational cost pose challenges for practical deployment. Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective strategy for efficient deployment, but we identify two key challenges in SAM that hinder the effectiveness of existing PTQ methods: the heavy-tailed and skewed distribution of post-GELU activations, and significant inter-channel variation in linear projection activations. To address these challenges, we propose AHCPTQ, an accurate and hardware-efficient PTQ method for SAM. AHCPTQ introduces hardware-compatible Hybrid Log-Uniform Quantization (HLUQ) to manage post-GELU activations, employing log2 quantization for dense small values and uniform quantization for sparse large values to enhance quantization resolution. Additionally, AHCPTQ incorporates Channel-Aware Grouping (CAG) to mitigate inter-channel variation by progressively clustering activation channels with similar distributions, enabling them to share quantization parameters and improving hardware efficiency. The combination of HLUQ and CAG not only enhances quantization effectiveness but also ensures compatibility with efficient hardware execution. For instance, under the W4A4 configuration on the SAM-L model, AHCPTQ achieves 36.6% mAP on instance segmentation with the DINO detector, while achieving a 7.89x speedup and 8.64x energy efficiency over its floating-point counterpart in FPGA implementation.",

One of the most advanced models for this task is Vertical Attention Network (VAN), which utilizes a Vertical Attention Module (VAM) to implicitly segment paragraph text images into text lines, thereby reducing the difficulty of the recognition task. However, from a network structure perspective, VAM is a single-branch module, which is less effective in learning compared to multi-branch modules. In this paper, we propose a new module, named Re-parameterizing Vertical Attention Fusion Module (RVAFM), which incorporates structural re-parameterization techniques. RVAFM decouples the structure of the module during training and inference stages. During training, it uses a multi-branch structure for more effective learning, and during inference, it uses a single-branch structure for faster processing. The features learned by the multi-branch structure are fused into the single-branch structure through a special fusion method named Re-parameterization Fusion (RF) without any loss of information. As a result, we achieve a Character Error Rate (CER) of 4.44% and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 14.37% on the IAM paragraph-level test set. Additionally, the inference speed is slightly faster than VAN.",

Recently, the use of deep learning has enabled automated classification of rice, im-proving accuracy and efficiency. However, classical models based on first-stage training may face difficulties in distinguishing between rice varieties with similar external characteristics, thus leading to misclassifications. Considering the transparency and feasibility of model, we selected and gradually improved pure fully connected neural network to achieve classification of rice grain. The dataset we used contains both global and domestic rice images obtained from websites and laboratories respectively. First, the training mode was changed from one-stage training to two-stage training, which significantly contributes to distinguishing two similar types of rice. Secondly, the preprocessing method was changed from random tilting to horizontal or vertical position cor-rection. After those two enhancements, the accuracy of our model increased notably from 97% to 99%. In summary, two subtle methods proposed in this study can remarkably enhance the classification ability of deep learning models in terms of the classification of rice grain.",

Consequently, thermal infrared images are employed to reconstruct 3D models that accurately reflect the temperature distribution of a scene, aiding in applications such as building monitoring and energy management. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on static 3D reconstruction for a single time period, overlooking the impact of environmental factors on thermal radiation and failing to predict or analyze temperature variations over time. To address these challenges, we propose the NTR-Gaussian method, which treats temperature as a form of thermal radiation, incorporating elements like convective heat transfer and radiative heat dissipation. Our approach utilizes neural networks to predict thermodynamic parameters such as emissivity, convective heat transfer coefficient, and heat capacity. By integrating these predictions, we can accurately forecast thermal temperatures at various times throughout a nighttime scene. Furthermore, we introduce a dynamic dataset specifically for nighttime thermal imagery. Extensive experiments and evaluations demonstrate that NTR-Gaussian significantly outperforms comparison methods in thermal reconstruction, achieving a predicted temperature error within 1 degree Celsius.",

This problem is particularly challenging due to the arbitrary parameterizations of these surfaces and their varying deformation speeds, necessitating effective spatiotemporal registration. Traditionally, 4D surfaces are discretized, in space and time, before computing their spatiotemporal registrations, geodesics, and statistics. However, this approach may result in suboptimal solutions and, as we demonstrate in this paper, is not necessary. In contrast, we treat 4D surfaces as continuous functions in both space and time. We introduce Dynamic Spherical Neural Surfaces (D-SNS), an efficient smooth and continuous spatiotemporal representation for genus-0 4D surfaces. We then demonstrate how to perform core 4D shape analysis tasks such as spatiotemporal registration, geodesics computation, and mean 4D shape estimation, directly on these continuous representations without upfront discretization and meshing. By integrating neural representations with classical Riemannian geometry and statistical shape analysis techniques, we provide the building blocks for enabling full functional shape analysis. We demonstrate the efficiency of the framework on 4D human and face datasets. The source code and additional results are available at https://4d-dsns.github.io/DSNS/.",

Despite their potential to reduce inference energy consumption, a performance gap persists between SNNs and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), primarily due to current training methods and inherent model limitations. While recent research has aimed to enhance SNN learning by employing knowledge distillation (KD) from ANN teacher networks, traditional distillation techniques often overlook the distinctive spatiotemporal properties of SNNs, thus failing to fully leverage their advantages. To overcome these challenge, we propose a novel logit distillation method characterized by temporal separation and entropy regularization. This approach improves existing SNN distillation techniques by performing distillation learning on logits across different time steps, rather than merely on aggregated output features. Furthermore, the integration of entropy regularization stabilizes model optimization and further boosts the performance. Extensive experimental results indicate that our method surpasses prior SNN distillation strategies, whether based on logit distillation, feature distillation, or a combination of both.

Depthwise onvolution (DWConv) is widely used in efficient CNNs or ViTs, but it needs frequent memory access during inference, which leads to low throughput. FasterNet attempts to introduce partial convolution (PConv) as an alternative to DWConv but compromises the accuracy due to underutilized channels. To remedy this shortcoming and consider the redundancy between feature map channels, we introduce a novel Partial visual ATtention mechanism (PAT) that can efficiently combine PConv with visual attention. Our exploration indicates that the partial attention mechanism can completely replace the full attention mechanism and reduce model parameters and FLOPs. Our PAT can derive three types of blocks: Partial Channel-Attention block (PAT_ch), Partial Spatial-Attention block (PAT_sp) and Partial Self-Attention block (PAT_sf). First, PAT_ch integrates the enhanced Gaussian channel attention mechanism to infuse global distribution information into the untouched channels of PConv. Second, we introduce the spatial-wise attention to the MLP layer to further improve model accuracy. Finally, we replace PAT_ch in the last stage with the self-attention mechanism to extend the global receptive field. Building upon PAT, we propose a novel hybrid network family, named PATNet, which achieves superior top-1 accuracy and inference speed compared to FasterNet on ImageNet-1K classification and excel in both detection and segmentation on the COCO dataset. Particularly, our PATNet-T2 achieves 1.3% higher accuracy than FasterNet-T2, while exhibiting 25% higher GPU throughput and 24% lower CPU latency.",

In this paper, we propose a variance-aware loss scheduling approach that dynamically adjusts the weighting of the contrastive loss based on the statistical variability (uncertainty) in the model's alignment predictions. Using a subset of the Flickr8k image-caption dataset to simulate limited data conditions, we demonstrate that our approach improves image-text retrieval accuracy compared to a fixed-weight baseline. We also compare against other adaptive weighting strategies (using output entropy and cosine similarity spread) and find that variance-aware scheduling provides the best overall trade-off. Qualitatively, our method yields more distinct multimodal embeddings as shown by t-SNE visualizations. Moreover, in a stress test with noise-injected captions and images, the variance-guided loss proves more robust, maintaining higher recall when random perturbations are introduced.

Two primary issues arise in this context. Firstly, existing methods rely on 3D motion data for training, which requires collection in limited environments. Acquiring such 3D labels for new actions in a timely manner is impractical, severely restricting the model's generalization capabilities. In contrast, 2D poses are far more accessible and easier to obtain. Secondly, estimating a person's absolute position in metric space from a single viewpoint is inherently more complex. To address these challenges, we introduce Mocap-2-to-3, a novel framework that decomposes intricate 3D motions into 2D poses, leveraging 2D data to enhance 3D motion reconstruction in diverse scenarios and accurately predict absolute positions in the world coordinate system. We initially pretrain a single-view diffusion model with extensive 2D data, followed by fine-tuning a multi-view diffusion model for view consistency using publicly available 3D data. This strategy facilitates the effective use of large-scale 2D data. Additionally, we propose an innovative human motion representation that decouples local actions from global movements and encodes geometric priors of the ground, ensuring the generative model learns accurate motion priors from 2D data. During inference, this allows for the gradual recovery of global movements, resulting in more plausible positioning.

We formulate the training of the computational cost-constrained matting network as a bilevel optimization problem, jointly optimizing the matting network and the path estimator. Building on this formalization, we design a path-adaptive matting architecture by incorporating path selection layers and learnable connect layers to estimate optimal paths and perform efficient inference within a unified network. Furthermore, we propose a performance-aware path-learning strategy to generate path labels online by evaluating a few paths sampled from the prior distribution of optimal paths and network estimations, enabling robust and efficient online path learning. Experiments on five image matting datasets demonstrate that the proposed PAM framework achieves competitive performance across a range of computational cost constraints.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03244v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Around 10% of newborns require some help to initiate breathing, and 5\\% need ventilation assistance. Accurate Time of Birth (ToB) documentation is essential for optimizing neonatal care, as timely interventions are vital for proper resuscitation. However, current clinical methods for recording ToB often rely on manual processes, which can be prone to inaccuracies. In this study, we present a novel two-stream fusion system that combines the power of image and video analysis to accurately detect the ToB from thermal recordings in the delivery room and operating theater. By integrating static and dynamic streams, our approach captures richer birth-related spatiotemporal features, leading to more robust and precise ToB estimation. We demonstrate that this synergy between data modalities enhances performance over single-stream approaches. Our system achieves 95.7% precision and 84.8% recall in detecting birth within short video clips. Additionally, with the help of a score aggregation module, it successfully identifies ToB in 100% of test cases, with a median absolute error of 2 seconds and an absolute mean deviation of 4.5 seconds compared to manual annotations.",

In this paper, we present a sufficient computational analysis of degradation modeling in BPIQA to thoroughly explore the \\textit{easy-database issue}, where we carefully design three types of experiments via investigating the gap between BPIQA and blind image quality assessment (BIQA), the necessity of specific design in BPIQA models, and the generalization ability of BPIQA models. From extensive experiments, we find that easy databases narrow the gap between the performance of BPIQA and BIQA models, which is unconducive to the development of BPIQA. And the easy databases make the BPIQA models be closed to saturation, therefore the effectiveness of the associated specific designs can not be well verified. Besides, the BPIQA models trained on our recently proposed databases with complicated degradation show better generalization ability.

Current advanced optical flow methods for event cameras largely adopt established image-based frameworks. However, the spatial sparsity of event data limits their performance. In this paper, we present BAT, an innovative framework that estimates event-based optical flow using bidirectional adaptive temporal correlation. BAT includes three novel designs: 1) a bidirectional temporal correlation that transforms bidirectional temporally dense motion cues into spatially dense ones, enabling accurate and spatially dense optical flow estimation; 2) an adaptive temporal sampling strategy for maintaining temporal consistency in correlation; 3) spatially adaptive temporal motion aggregation to efficiently and adaptively aggregate consistent target motion features into adjacent motion features while suppressing inconsistent ones. Our results rank $1^{st}$ on the DSEC-Flow benchmark, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by a large margin while also exhibiting sharp edges and high-quality details.

Directly applying 2D convolutions for cost aggregation often results in edge blurring, detail loss, and mismatches in textureless regions. Some complex operations, like deformable convolutions and iterative warping, can partially alleviate this issue; however, they are not mobile-friendly, limiting their deployment on mobile devices. In this paper, we present a novel bilateral aggregation network (BANet) for mobile stereo matching that produces high-quality results with sharp edges and fine details using only 2D convolutions. Specifically, we first separate the full cost volume into detailed and smooth volumes using a spatial attention map, then perform detailed and smooth aggregations accordingly, ultimately fusing both to obtain the final disparity map. Additionally, to accurately identify high-frequency detailed regions and low-frequency smooth/textureless regions, we propose a new scale-aware spatial attention module. Experimental results demonstrate that our BANet-2D significantly outperforms other mobile-friendly methods, achieving 35.3\\% higher accuracy on the KITTI 2015 leaderboard than MobileStereoNet-2D, with faster runtime on mobile devices.

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03272v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown their competence in handling spatial-temporal event-based data with low energy consumption. Similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs), SNNs are also vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks, wherein gradients are calculated by spatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs). However, the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not influence the inference results, and current gradient-based attacks are ineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through universal SGs, their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover, the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based binary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper, we introduce an innovative potential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust connection between the SG and the model, thereby enhancing the adaptability of adversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs. Additionally, we propose the sparse dynamic attack (SDA) to effectively attack binary dynamic images. Utilizing a generation-reduction paradigm, SDA can fully optimize the sparsity of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that our PDSG and SDA outperform state-of-the-art SNN-based attacks across various models and datasets. Specifically, our PDSG achieves 100% attack success rate on ImageNet, and our SDA obtains 82% attack success rate by modifying only 0.24% of the pixels on CIFAR10DVS.

However, their effectiveness in the medical domain, particularly for abnormality detection and localization within medical images, remains underexplored. A major challenge is the complex and abstract nature of medical terminology, which makes it difficult to directly associate pathological anomaly terms with their corresponding visual features. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to enhance VLM performance in medical abnormality detection and localization by leveraging decomposed medical knowledge. Instead of directly prompting models to recognize specific abnormalities, we focus on breaking down medical concepts into fundamental attributes and common visual patterns. This strategy promotes a stronger alignment between textual descriptions and visual features, improving both the recognition and localization of abnormalities in medical images.We evaluate our method on the 0.23B Florence-2 base model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance in abnormality grounding to significantly larger 7B LLaVA-based medical VLMs, despite being trained on only 1.5% of the data used for such models. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both known and previously unseen abnormalities, suggesting its strong generalization capabilities.",

Conversely, LiDAR and radar sensors remain almost unaffected in these scenarios, and radar provides key velocity information of the objects. Therefore, we introduce BEVMOSNet, to our knowledge, the first end-to-end multimodal fusion leveraging cameras, LiDAR, and radar to precisely predict the moving objects in BEV. In addition, we perform a deeper analysis to find out the optimal strategy for deformable cross-attention-guided sensor fusion for cross-sensor knowledge sharing in BEV. While evaluating BEVMOSNet on the nuScenes dataset, we show an overall improvement in IoU score of 36.59% compared to the vision-based unimodal baseline BEV-MoSeg (Sigatapu et al., 2023), and 2.35% compared to the multimodel SimpleBEV (Harley et al., 2022), extended for the motion segmentation task, establishing this method as the state-of-the-art in BEV motion segmentation.",

In this paper, we first introduce a single-parameter Prior Model based on Gaussian (highpass/lowpass) Filtering (PM-GF), in which the filtering output is the sum of a weighted portion of Gaussian highpass filtering of the guidance image and Gaussian smoothing of the input image. In the PM-GF, the guidance structure determined by Gaussian highpass filtering is obviously transferred to the filtering output, thereby better revealing the structure transfer mechanism of guided filtering. Then we propose several Gaussian highpass GIFs (GH-GIFs) based on the PM-GF by emulating the original GIF and some improvements, i.e., using PM-GF instead of LAM in these GIFs.

Traditional methods often rely heavily on extensive annotated datasets, computationally expensive pipelines, and large pre-trained models, specifically in the domain of Vietnamese VQA, limiting their applicability in such scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a training framework that combines a paraphrase-based feature augmentation module with a dynamic curriculum learning strategy. Explicitly, augmented samples are considered \"easy\" while raw samples are regarded as \"hard\". The framework then utilizes a mechanism that dynamically adjusts the ratio of easy to hard samples during training, progressively modifying the same dataset to increase its difficulty level. By enabling gradual adaptation to task complexity, this approach helps the Vietnamese VQA model generalize well, thus improving overall performance. Experimental results show consistent improvements on the OpenViVQA dataset and mixed outcomes on the ViVQA dataset, highlighting both the potential and challenges of our approach in advancing VQA for Vietnamese language.",

Ideally, these models should focus on key visual information relevant to the text token. However, recent findings indicate that LMMs have an extraordinary tendency to consistently allocate high attention weights to specific visual tokens, even when these tokens are irrelevant to the corresponding text. In this study, we investigate the property behind the appearance of these irrelevant visual tokens and examine their characteristics. Our findings show that this behavior arises due to the massive activation of certain hidden state dimensions, which resembles the attention sink found in language models. Hence, we refer to this phenomenon as the visual attention sink. In particular, our analysis reveals that removing the irrelevant visual sink tokens does not impact model performance, despite receiving high attention weights. Consequently, we recycle the attention to these tokens as surplus resources, redistributing the attention budget to enhance focus on the image. To achieve this, we introduce Visual Attention Redistribution (VAR), a method that redistributes attention in image-centric heads, which we identify as innately focusing on visual information. VAR can be seamlessly applied across different LMMs to improve performance on a wide range of tasks, including general vision-language tasks, visual hallucination tasks, and vision-centric tasks, all without the need for additional training, models, or inference steps. Experimental results demonstrate that VAR enables LMMs to process visual information more effectively by adjusting their internal attention mechanisms, offering a new direction to enhancing the multimodal capabilities of LMMs.",

The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Due to limited computational resources and training data, our experiments provide empirical evidence of the algorithm's strong super-resolution capabilities using synthetic data.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03365v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present TopoMortar, a brick wall dataset that is the first dataset specifically designed to evaluate topology-focused image segmentation methods, such as topology loss functions. TopoMortar enables to investigate in two ways whether methods incorporate prior topological knowledge. First, by eliminating challenges seen in real-world data, such as small training set, noisy labels, and out-of-distribution test-set images, that, as we show, impact the effectiveness of topology losses. Second, by allowing to assess in the same dataset topology accuracy across dataset challenges, isolating dataset-related effects from the effect of incorporating prior topological knowledge. In these two experiments, it is deliberately difficult to improve topology accuracy without actually using topology information, thus, permitting to attribute an improvement in topology accuracy to the incorporation of prior topological knowledge. To this end, TopoMortar includes three types of labels (accurate, noisy, pseudo-labels), two fixed training sets (large and small), and in-distribution and out-of-distribution test-set images. We compared eight loss functions on TopoMortar, and we found that clDice achieved the most topologically accurate segmentations, Skeleton Recall loss performed best particularly with noisy labels, and the relative advantageousness of the other loss functions depended on the experimental setting. Additionally, we show that simple methods, such as data augmentation and self-distillation, can elevate Cross entropy Dice loss to surpass most topology loss functions, and that those simple methods can enhance topology loss functions as well. clDice and Skeleton Recall loss, both skeletonization-based loss functions, were also the fastest to train, making this type of loss function a promising research direction.

While algorithmic fairness is well-studied in simple binary classification tasks on tabular data, its application to complex, real-world scenarios-such as Facial Expression Recognition (FER)-remains underexplored. FER presents unique challenges: it is inherently multiclass, and biases emerge across intersecting demographic variables, each potentially comprising multiple protected groups. We present a comprehensive framework to analyze bias propagation from datasets to trained models in image-based FER systems, while introducing new bias metrics specifically designed for multiclass problems with multiple demographic groups. Our methodology studies bias propagation by (1) inducing controlled biases in FER datasets, (2) training models on these biased datasets, and (3) analyzing the correlation between dataset bias metrics and model fairness notions. Our findings reveal that stereotypical biases propagate more strongly to model predictions than representational biases, suggesting that preventing emotion-specific demographic patterns should be prioritized over general demographic balance in FER datasets. Additionally, we observe that biased datasets lead to reduced model accuracy, challenging the assumed fairness-accuracy trade-off.",

These parameters can be accurately computed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but CFD is computationally intensive. Hence, deep learning methods have been adopted as a surrogate to rapidly estimate CFD outcomes. A drawback of such data-driven models is the need for time-consuming reference CFD simulations for training. In this work, we introduce an active learning framework to reduce the number of CFD simulations required for the training of surrogate models, lowering the barriers to their deployment in new applications. We propose three distinct querying strategies to determine for which unlabeled samples CFD simulations should be obtained. These querying strategies are based on geometrical variance, ensemble uncertainty, and adherence to the physics governing fluid dynamics. We benchmark these methods on velocity field estimation in synthetic coronary artery bifurcations and find that they allow for substantial reductions in annotation cost. Notably, we find that our strategies reduce the number of samples required by up to 50% and make the trained models more robust to difficult cases.

While multi-scale and long-range spatial correlations are essential in unmixing tasks, current Transformer-based unmixing networks, built on Vision Transformer (ViT) or Swin-Transformer, struggle to capture them effectively. Additionally, current Transformer-based unmixing networks rely on the linear mixing model, which lacks the flexibility to accommodate scenarios where nonlinear effects are significant. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-scale Dilated Transformer-based unmixing network for nonlinear HU (DTU-Net). The encoder employs two branches. The first one performs multi-scale spatial feature extraction using Multi-Scale Dilated Attention (MSDA) in the Dilated Transformer, which varies dilation rates across attention heads to capture long-range and multi-scale spatial correlations. The second one performs spectral feature extraction utilizing 3D-CNNs with channel attention. The outputs from both branches are then fused to integrate multi-scale spatial and spectral information, which is subsequently transformed to estimate the abundances. The decoder is designed to accommodate both linear and nonlinear mixing scenarios. Its interpretability is enhanced by explicitly modeling the relationships between endmembers, abundances, and nonlinear coefficients in accordance with the polynomial post-nonlinear mixing model (PPNMM). Experiments on synthetic and real datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed DTU-Net compared to PPNMM-derived methods and several advanced unmixing networks.",

Even ASIFT, which is built upon SIFT and entails a considerable number of image comparisons simulated by affine transformations, inevitably exhibits the drawbacks of being time-consuming and imposing high demands on memory usage. And the stability of feature extraction drops rapidly under large-view affine transformations. Consequently, we propose a method that represents an improvement over ASIFT. On the premise of improving the precision and maintaining the affine invariance, it currently ranks as the fastest feature extraction method for extra-affine images that we know of at present. Simultaneously, the stability of feature extraction regarding affine transformation images has been approximated to the maximum limits. Both the angle between the shooting direction and the normal direction of the photographed object (absolute tilt angle), and the shooting transformation angle between two images (transition tilt angle) are close to 90 degrees. The central idea of the method lies in obtaining the optimal parameter set by simulating affine transformation with the reference image. And the simulated affine transformation is reproduced by combining it with the Lanczos interpolation based on the optimal parameter set. Subsequently, it is combined with ORB, which exhibits excellent real-time performance for rapid orientation binary description. Moreover, a scale parameter simulation is introduced to further augment the operational efficiency.",

However, this approach often struggles with ambiguous target identification, particularly in scenes with multiple similar objects, and fails to ensure consistent mask propagation across frames. To address these limitations, we introduce FindTrack, a novel decoupled framework that separates target identification from mask propagation. FindTrack first adaptively selects a key frame by balancing segmentation confidence and vision-text alignment, establishing a robust reference for the target object. This reference is then utilized by a dedicated propagation module to track and segment the object across the entire video. By decoupling these processes, FindTrack effectively reduces ambiguities in target association and enhances segmentation consistency. We demonstrate that FindTrack outperforms existing methods on public benchmarks.",

Gait recognition performance is commonly evaluated by ranking a gallery of candidates and measuring the accuracy at the top Rank-$K$. Existing models are typically single-staged, i.e. searching for the probe's nearest neighbors in a gallery using a single global feature representation. Although these models typically excel at retrieving the correct identity within the top-$K$ predictions, they struggle when hard negatives appear in the top short-list, leading to relatively low performance at the highest ranks (e.g., Rank-1). In this paper, we introduce CarGait, a Cross-Attention Re-ranking method for gait recognition, that involves re-ordering the top-$K$ list leveraging the fine-grained correlations between pairs of gait sequences through cross-attention between gait strips. This re-ranking scheme can be adapted to existing single-stage models to enhance their final results.

Therefore, imaging is often complemented with point-wise Energy-Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy (EDS) spectral measurements that provide highly accurate information about the chemical composition but that are time-consuming to acquire. This motivates the use of sparse spectral data in conjunction with BSE images for mineral segmentation. The unstructured nature of the spectral data makes most traditional image fusion techniques unsuitable for BSE-EDS fusion. We propose using graph neural networks to fuse the two modalities and segment the mineral phases simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that providing EDS data for as few as 1% of BSE pixels produces accurate segmentation, enabling rapid analysis of mineral samples. The proposed data fusion pipeline is versatile and can be adapted to other domains that involve image data and point-wise measurements.",

However, existing methods for identifying frequency shortcuts require expensive computations and become impractical for analyzing models trained on large datasets. In this work, we propose the first approach to more efficiently analyze frequency shortcuts at a larger scale. We show that both CNN and transformer models learn frequency shortcuts on ImageNet. We also expose that frequency shortcut solutions can yield good performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets which largely retain texture information. However, these shortcuts, mostly aligned with texture patterns, hinder model generalization on rendition-based OOD test sets. These observations suggest that current OOD evaluations often overlook the impact of frequency shortcuts on model generalization.

Traditional loss functions, such as margin-based, hard-sample mining-based, and hybrid approaches, have achieved notable performance improvements, with some leveraging curriculum learning to optimize training. However, these methods often fall short in effectively quantifying the difficulty of hard samples. To address this, we propose Adaptive Sine (AdaSin) loss function, which introduces the sine of the angle between a sample's embedding feature and its ground-truth class center as a novel difficulty metric. This metric enables precise and effective penalization of hard samples. By incorporating curriculum learning, the model dynamically adjusts classification boundaries across different training stages. Unlike previous adaptive-margin loss functions, AdaSin introduce a dual adaptive penalty, applied to both the positive and negative cosine similarities of hard samples. This design imposes stronger constraints, enhancing intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. The combination of the dual adaptive penalty and curriculum learning is guided by a well-designed difficulty metric. It enables the model to focus more effectively on hard samples in later training stages, and lead to the extraction of highly discriminative face features. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that AdaSin achieves superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03556v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Object affordance reasoning, the ability to infer object functionalities based on physical properties, is fundamental for task-oriented planning and activities in both humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI). This capability, required for planning and executing daily activities in a task-oriented manner, relies on commonsense knowledge of object physics and functionalities, extending beyond simple object recognition. Current computational models for affordance reasoning from perception lack generalizability, limiting their applicability in novel scenarios. Meanwhile, comprehensive Large Language Models (LLMs) with emerging reasoning capabilities are challenging to deploy on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. Here, we introduce LVIS-Aff, a large-scale dataset comprising 1,496 tasks and 119k images, designed to enhance the generalizability of affordance reasoning from perception. Utilizing this dataset, we develop Afford-X, an end-to-end trainable affordance reasoning model that incorporates Verb Attention and Bi-Fusion modules to improve multi-modal understanding. This model achieves up to a 12.1% performance improvement over the best-reported results from non-LLM methods, while also demonstrating a 1.2% enhancement compared to our previous conference paper. Additionally, it maintains a compact 187M parameter size and infers nearly 50 times faster than the GPT-4V API. Our work demonstrates the potential for efficient, generalizable affordance reasoning models that can be deployed on local devices for task-oriented manipulations. We showcase Afford-X's effectiveness in enabling task-oriented manipulations for robots across various tasks and environments, underscoring its efficiency and broad implications for advancing robotics and AI systems in real-world applications.",

However, this special camera setup poses a new imaging challenge since camera configurations can change every time surgeons move the light, and manual image alignment is required. This paper proposes an algorithm to automate this alignment task. The proposed method detects frames where the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion.

However, current IAD algorithms are largely developed and tested on static, semantically simple datasets, which diverge from real-world scenarios where physical understanding and reasoning are essential.To bridge this gap, we introduce the Physics Anomaly Detection (Phys-AD) dataset, the first large-scale, real-world, physics-grounded video dataset for industrial anomaly detection. Collected using a real robot arm and motor, Phys-AD provides a diverse set of dynamic, semantically rich scenarios. The dataset includes more than 6400 videos across 22 real-world object categories, interacting with robot arms and motors, and exhibits 47 types of anomalies. Anomaly detection in Phys-AD requires visual reasoning, combining both physical knowledge and video content to determine object abnormality.We benchmark state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods under three settings: unsupervised AD, weakly-supervised AD, and video-understanding AD, highlighting their limitations in handling physics-grounded anomalies.

To identify potential revisits, we employ a scalable bag-of-words approach, pooling one learned global feature per submap.

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03613v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Despite its prevalent use in image-text matching tasks in a zero-shot manner, CLIP has been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations added onto images. Recent studies propose to finetune the vision encoder of CLIP with adversarial samples generated on the fly, and show improved robustness against adversarial attacks on a spectrum of downstream datasets, a property termed as zero-shot robustness. In this paper, we show that malicious perturbations that seek to maximise the classification loss lead to `falsely stable' images, and propose to leverage the pre-trained vision encoder of CLIP to counterattack such adversarial images during inference to achieve robustness. Our paradigm is simple and training-free, providing the first method to defend CLIP from adversarial attacks at test time, which is orthogonal to existing methods aiming to boost zero-shot adversarial robustness of CLIP. We conduct experiments across 16 classification datasets, and demonstrate stable and consistent gains compared to test-time defence methods adapted from existing adversarial robustness studies that do not rely on external networks, without noticeably impairing performance on clean images. We also show that our paradigm can be employed on CLIP models that have been adversarially finetuned to further enhance their robustness at test time.

However, directly applying GT-Aug to 4D Radar tensor data overlooks important measurements outside the GT bboxes-such as sidelobes-leading to synthetic distributions that deviate from real-world 4D Radar data. To address this limitation, we propose 4D Radar Ground Truth Augmentation (4DR GT-Aug). Our approach first augments LiDAR data and then converts it to 4D Radar data via a LiDAR-to-4D Radar data synthesis (L2RDaS) module, which explicitly accounts for measurements both inside and outside GT bboxes. In doing so, it produces 4D Radar data distributions that more closely resemble real-world measurements, thereby improving object detection accuracy. Experiments on the K-Radar dataset show that the proposed method achieves improved performance compared to conventional GT-Aug in object detection for 4D Radar.

A hybrid illumination compensation strategy combining CLAHE, Gamma correction, and Retinex enhances visibility. A two-stage filtering process, including spatial-domain (Gaussian, Bilateral, Guided) and frequency-domain (Fourier, Wavelet) methods, effectively reduces noise while preserving details. To correct color distortion, an adaptive color compensation (ACC) model estimates spectral attenuation and water type to combine RCP, DCP, and MUDCP dynamically.

However, adapting to some complex domains remains challenging, especially when these domains require substantial paired data to capture the targeted distributions. Since unpaired data from a single modality, such as vision or language, is more readily available, we utilize the bidirectional mappings between vision and language learned by the unified generative model to enable training on unpaired data for domain adaptation. Specifically, we propose DoraCycle, which integrates two multimodal cycles: text-to-image-to-text and image-to-text-to-image. The model is optimized through cross-entropy loss computed at the cycle endpoints, where both endpoints share the same modality. This facilitates self-evolution of the model without reliance on annotated text-image pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that for tasks independent of paired knowledge, such as stylization, DoraCycle can effectively adapt the unified model using only unpaired data. For tasks involving new paired knowledge, such as specific identities, a combination of a small set of paired image-text examples and larger-scale unpaired data is sufficient for effective domain-oriented adaptation.

In this work, we present DualDiff, a dual-branch conditional diffusion model designed to enhance driving scene generation across multiple views and video sequences. Specifically, we introduce Occupancy Ray-shape Sampling (ORS) as a conditional input, offering rich foreground and background semantics alongside 3D spatial geometry to precisely control the generation of both elements. To improve the synthesis of fine-grained foreground objects, particularly complex and distant ones, we propose a Foreground-Aware Mask (FGM) denoising loss function.

Due to appearance ambiguities, rotational symmetries, and severe occlusions, single-view based 6D pose estimators are still unable to handle a wide range of objects, motivating research towards multi-view pose estimation and next-best-view prediction that addresses these limitations. In this work, we propose a comprehensive active perception framework for estimating the 6D poses of textureless objects using only RGB images. Our approach is built upon a key idea: decoupling the 6D pose estimation into a sequential two-step process can greatly improve both accuracy and efficiency. First, we estimate the 3D translation of each object, resolving scale and depth ambiguities inherent to RGB images. These estimates are then used to simplify the subsequent task of determining the 3D orientation, which we achieve through canonical scale template matching. Building on this formulation, we then introduce an active perception strategy that predicts the next best camera viewpoint to capture an RGB image, effectively reducing object pose uncertainty and enhancing pose accuracy. We evaluate our method on the public ROBI dataset as well as on a transparent object dataset that we created. When evaluated using the same camera viewpoints, our multi-view pose estimation significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

However, the trade-off between self-supervision and pseudo-supervision can give rise to three primary issues. The joint training causes Feature Randomness and Feature Drift, whereas the independent training causes Feature Randomness and Feature Twist. In essence, using pseudo-labels generates random and unreliable features. The combination of pseudo-supervision and self-supervision drifts the reliable clustering-oriented features. Moreover, moving from self-supervision to pseudo-supervision can twist the curved latent manifolds. This paper addresses the limitations of existing deep clustering paradigms concerning Feature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Feature Twist. We propose a new paradigm with a new strategy that replaces pseudo-supervision with a second round of self-supervision training. The new strategy makes the transition between instance-level self-supervision and neighborhood-level self-supervision smoother and less abrupt. Moreover, it prevents the drifting effect that is caused by the strong competition between instance-level self-supervision and clustering-level pseudo-supervision. Moreover, the absence of the pseudo-supervision prevents the risk of generating random features. With this novel approach, our paper introduces a Rethinking of the Deep Clustering Paradigms, denoted by R-DC. Our model is specifically designed to address three primary challenges encountered in Deep Clustering: Feature Randomness, Feature Drift, and Feature Twist.

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.03751v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video.

The performance of VLA models can be improved by integrating with action chunking, a critical technique for effective control. However, action chunking linearly scales up action dimensions in VLA models with increased chunking sizes. This reduces the inference efficiency. To tackle this problem, we propose PD-VLA, the first parallel decoding framework for VLA models integrated with action chunking. Our framework reformulates autoregressive decoding as a nonlinear system solved by parallel fixed-point iterations. This approach preserves model performance with mathematical guarantees while significantly improving decoding speed. In addition, it enables training-free acceleration without architectural changes, as well as seamless synergy with existing acceleration techniques. Extensive simulations validate that our PD-VLA maintains competitive success rates while achieving 2.52 times execution frequency on manipulators (with 7 degrees of freedom) compared with the fundamental VLA model. Furthermore, we experimentally identify the most effective settings for acceleration. Finally, real-world experiments validate its high applicability across different tasks.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.02892v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly contributing to mortality, particularly in older populations. While pulmonary vein isolation is a standard treatment, its effectiveness is limited in patients with persistent AF. Recent research highlights the importance of targeting additional atrial regions, particularly fibrotic areas identified via late gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI). However, existing manual segmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to variability. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in automating segmentation. However, most studies focus solely on the left atrium (LA) and rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework incorporating ResNeXt encoders and a cyclic learning rate to segment both the right atrium (RA) and LA walls and cavities in LGE-MRIs. Our method aims to improve the segmentation of challenging small structures, such as atrial walls while maintaining high performance in larger regions like the atrial cavities. The results demonstrate that our approach offers superior segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to traditional architectures, particularly for imbalanced class structures.",

Therefore, many neuroimaging studies are curated with various imaging modalities, e.g., MRI and PET, however, it is often challenging to acquire all of them from all subjects and missing data become inevitable. In this regards, in this paper, we propose a framework that generates unobserved imaging measures for specific subjects using their existing measures, thereby reducing the need for additional examinations. Our framework transfers modality-specific style while preserving AD-specific content. This is done by domain adversarial training that preserves modality-agnostic but AD-specific information, while a generative adversarial network adds an indistinguishable modality-specific style. Our proposed framework is evaluated on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and compared with other imputation methods in terms of generated data quality. Small average Cohen's $d$ $< 0.19$ between our generated measures and real ones suggests that the synthetic data are practically usable regardless of their modality type.",

It often involves multiple imaging modalities to understand the complex pathology of AD, however, acquiring a complete set of images is challenging due to high cost and burden for subjects. In the end, missing data become inevitable which lead to limited sample-size and decrease in precision in downstream analyses. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a holistic imaging feature imputation method that enables to leverage diverse imaging features while retaining all subjects. The proposed method comprises two networks: 1) An encoder to extract modality-independent embeddings and 2) A decoder to reconstruct the original measures conditioned on their imaging modalities. The encoder includes a novel {\\em ordinal contrastive loss}, which aligns samples in the embedding space according to the progression of AD. We also maximize modality-wise coherence of embeddings within each subject, in conjunction with domain adversarial training algorithms, to further enhance alignment between different imaging modalities.

To overcome this limitation, we present a deep learning-based approach that restores and enhances pixel resolution post-acquisition without any a priori knowledge.

In this study, we evaluate and compare the ability of local and global shape features to predict ascending aortic aneurysm growth.\n  Material and methods: 70 patients with aneurysm, for which two 3D acquisitions were available, are included. Following segmentation, three local shape features are computed: (1) the ratio between maximum diameter and length of the ascending aorta centerline, (2) the ratio between the length of external and internal lines on the ascending aorta and (3) the tortuosity of the ascending tract. By exploiting longitudinal data, the aneurysm growth rate is derived. Using radial basis function mesh morphing, iso-topological surface meshes are created. Statistical shape analysis is performed through unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and supervised partial least squares (PLS). Two types of global shape features are identified: three PCA-derived and three PLS-based shape modes. Three regression models are set for growth prediction: two based on gaussian support vector machine using local and PCA-derived global shape features; the third is a PLS linear regression model based on the related global shape features. The prediction results are assessed and the aortic shapes most prone to growth are identified.\n  Results: the prediction root mean square error from leave-one-out cross-validation is: 0.112 mm/month, 0.083 mm/month and 0.066 mm/month for local, PCA-based and PLS-derived shape features, respectively. Aneurysms close to the root with a large initial diameter report faster growth.\n  Conclusion: global shape features might provide an important contribution for predicting the aneurysm growth.",

WarmFed customizes Warm-start through personalized diffusion models, which are generated by local efficient fine-tunining (LoRA). Building upon the Warm-Start, we advance a server-side fine-tuning strategy to derive the global model, and propose a dynamic self-distillation (DSD) to procure more resilient personalized models simultaneously.

However, their identification remains particularly challenging due to their limited number and heterogeneity. Labeling samples for contrast limits the generalization of fluorescence-based methods across different hospital datasets. Analyzing single-cell images enables detailed assessment of cell morphology, subcellular structures, and phenotypic variations, often hidden in clustered images. Developing a method based on bright-field single-cell analysis could overcome these limitations. CTCs can be isolated using an unbiased workflow combining Parsortix technology, which selects cells based on size and deformability, with DEPArray technology, enabling precise visualization and selection of single cells. Traditionally, DEPArray-acquired digital images are manually analyzed, making the process time-consuming and prone to variability. In this study, we present a Deep Learning-based classification pipeline designed to distinguish CTCs from leukocytes in blood samples, aimed to enhance diagnostic accuracy and optimize clinical workflows. Our approach employs images from the bright-field channel acquired through DEPArray technology leveraging a ResNet-based CNN. To improve model generalization, we applied three types of data augmentation techniques and incorporated fluorescence (DAPI) channel images into the training phase, allowing the network to learn additional CTC-specific features. Notably, only bright-field images have been used for testing, ensuring the model's ability to identify CTCs without relying on fluorescence markers. The proposed model achieved an F1-score of 0.798, demonstrating its capability to distinguish CTCs from leukocytes. These findings highlight the potential of DL in refining CTC analysis and advancing liquid biopsy applications.",

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) shows promise in ground truth-scarce tasks, but its application in reconstruction remains underexplored. Although multiple overlapping-echo detachment (MOLED) achieves ultra-fast multi-parametric reconstruction, extending its application to various clinical scenarios, the quality suffers from deficiency in mitigating the domain gap, difficulty in maintaining structural integrity, and inadequacy in ensuring mapping accuracy. To resolve these issues, we proposed frequency-aware perturbation and selection (FPS), comprising Wasserstein distance-modulated frequency-aware perturbation (WDFP) and hierarchical frequency-aware selection network (HFSNet), which integrates frequency-aware adaptive selection (FAS), compact FAS (cFAS) and feature-aware architecture integration (FAI). Specifically, perturbation activates domain-invariant feature learning within uncertainty, while selection refines optimal solutions within perturbation, establishing a robust and closed-loop learning pathway. Extensive experiments on synthetic data, along with diverse real clinical cases from 5 healthy volunteers, 94 ischemic stroke patients, and 46 meningioma patients, demonstrate the superiority and clinical applicability of FPS. Furthermore, FPS is applied to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), underscoring its versatility and potential for broader medical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/flyannie/FPS.",

Existing approaches require fine-tuning pre-trained visionlanguage models (VLMs) as visual and language features are independently fed into downstream policies, degrading the pre-trained semantic alignments. We propose OTTER, a novel VLA architecture that leverages these existing alignments through explicit, text-aware visual feature extraction. Instead of processing all visual features, OTTER selectively extracts and passes only task-relevant visual features that are semantically aligned with the language instruction to the policy transformer. This allows OTTER to keep the pre-trained vision-language encoders frozen. Thereby, OTTER preserves and utilizes the rich semantic understanding learned from large-scale pre-training, enabling strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. In simulation and real-world experiments, OTTER significantly outperforms existing VLA models, demonstrating strong zeroshot generalization to novel objects and environments.

In recent years, multi-scale exposure fusion approaches based on detail-enhancement have led the way for improvement in highlight and shadow details. Most of such methods, however, are too computationally expensive to be deployed on mobile devices. This paper presents a perceptual multi-exposure fusion method that not just ensures fine shadow/highlight details but with lower complexity than detailenhanced methods. We analyze the potential defects of three classical exposure measures in lieu of using detail-enhancement component and improve two of them, namely adaptive Wellexposedness (AWE) and the gradient of color images (3-D gradient). AWE designed in YCbCr color space considers the difference between varying exposure images. 3-D gradient is employed to extract fine details. We build a large-scale multiexposure benchmark dataset suitable for static scenes, which contains 167 image sequences all told. Experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate that the proposed method exceeds existing eight state-of-the-art approaches in terms of visually and MEF-SSIM value.

To mitigate this, we advocate for incorporating hypernetworks into single-scene and multiscene camera pose regression models. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically computes adaptive weights for the localization regression heads based on the particular input image, effectively narrowing the domain gap. Using indoor and outdoor datasets, we evaluate the HyperPose methodology across multiple established absolute pose regression architectures.

However, text-to-image diffusion models sometimes struggle to create high-fidelity content for the given input prompt. One specific issue is their difficulty in generating the precise number of objects specified in the text prompt. For example, when provided with the prompt \"five apples and ten lemons on a table,\" images generated by diffusion models often contain an incorrect number of objects. In this paper, we present a method to improve diffusion models so that they accurately produce the correct object count based on the input prompt. We adopt a counting network that performs reference-less class-agnostic counting for any given image. We calculate the gradients of the counting network and refine the predicted noise for each step. To address the presence of multiple types of objects in the prompt, we utilize novel attention map guidance to obtain high-quality masks for each object. Finally, we guide the denoising process using the calculated gradients for each object. Through extensive experiments and evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the fidelity of diffusion models with respect to object count.

To address this, we propose Stochastic Consistency Distillation (SCott) to enable accelerated text-to-image generation, where high-quality and diverse generations can be achieved within just 2-4 sampling steps. In contrast to vanilla consistency distillation (CD) which distills the ordinary differential equation solvers-based sampling process of a pre-trained teacher model into a student, SCott explores the possibility and validates the efficacy of integrating stochastic differential equation (SDE) solvers into CD to fully unleash the potential of the teacher. SCott is augmented with elaborate strategies to control the noise strength and sampling process of the SDE solver. An adversarial loss is further incorporated to strengthen the consistency constraints in rare sampling steps. Empirically, on the MSCOCO-2017 5K dataset with a Stable Diffusion-V1.5 teacher, SCott achieves an FID of 21.9 with 2 sampling steps, surpassing that of the 1-step InstaFlow (23.4) and the 4-step UFOGen (22.1).

In this work, we introduce HyDRa, a novel camera-radar fusion architecture for diverse 3D perception tasks. Building upon the principles of dense BEV (Bird's Eye View)-based architectures, HyDRa introduces a hybrid fusion approach to combine the strengths of complementary camera and radar features in two distinct representation spaces. Our Height Association Transformer module leverages radar features already in the perspective view to produce more robust and accurate depth predictions. In the BEV, we refine the initial sparse representation by a Radar-weighted Depth Consistency. HyDRa achieves a new state-of-the-art for camera-radar fusion of 64.2 NDS (+1.8) and 58.4 AMOTA (+1.5) on the public nuScenes dataset.

With vision-based navigation, when combined with pre-operative imaging data as priors, it is possible to recover position and pose of the endoscope without the need of additional sensors. In practice, however, aligning pre-operative and intra-operative domains is complicated by significant texture differences. Although methods such as style transfer can be used to address this issue, they require large datasets from both source and target domains with prolonged training times. This paper proposes an efficient domain transfer method based on stylized Gaussian splatting, only requiring a few of real images (10 images) with very fast training time. Specifically, the transfer process includes two phases. In the first phase, the 3D models reconstructed from CT scans are represented as differential Gaussian point clouds. In the second phase, only color appearance related parameters are optimized to transfer the style and preserve the visual content. A novel structure consistency loss is applied to latent features and depth levels to enhance the stability of the transferred images. Detailed validation was performed to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed method compared to that of the current state-of-the-art, highlighting the potential for intra-operative surgical navigation.",

However, such a handcrafting manner of layer removal is inefficient and lacks scalability and generalization, and the feature distillation employed in the retraining phase faces an imbalance issue that a few numerically significant feature loss terms dominate over others throughout the retraining process. To this end, we proposed the layer pruning and normalized distillation for compressing diffusion models (LAPTOP-Diff). We, 1) introduced the layer pruning method to compress SDM's U-Net automatically and proposed an effective one-shot pruning criterion whose one-shot performance is guaranteed by its good additivity property, surpassing other layer pruning and handcrafted layer removal methods, 2) proposed the normalized feature distillation for retraining, alleviated the imbalance issue. Using the proposed LAPTOP-Diff, we compressed the U-Nets of SDXL and SDM-v1.5 for the most advanced performance, achieving a minimal 4.0% decline in PickScore at a pruning ratio of 50% while the comparative methods' minimal PickScore decline is 8.2%.",

To this end, we develop a novel Multi-Velocity Progressive-alignment (MVP-Shot) framework to progressively learn and align semantic-related action features at multi-velocity levels. Concretely, a Multi-Velocity Feature Alignment (MVFA) module is designed to measure the similarity between features from support and query videos with different velocity scales and then merge all similarity scores in a residual fashion. To avoid the multiple velocity features deviating from the underlying motion semantic, our proposed Progressive Semantic-Tailored Interaction (PSTI) module injects velocity-tailored text information into the video feature via feature interaction on channel and temporal domains at different velocities. The above two modules compensate for each other to make more accurate query sample predictions under the few-shot settings.

Even worse, the significant inference time overhead and limited performance against unseen attacks make existing techniques impractical for real-world use. In this paper, we explore the proximity relationship among adversarial noise distributions and demonstrate the existence of an open covering for these distributions. By training on the open covering of adversarial noise distributions, a detector with strong generalization performance against various types of unseen attacks can be developed. Based on this insight, we heuristically propose Perturbation Forgery, which includes noise distribution perturbation, sparse mask generation, and pseudo-adversarial data production, to train an adversarial detector capable of detecting any unseen gradient-based, generative-based, and physical adversarial attacks.

Despite its advantages in rendering speed and image fidelity, 3DGS is limited by its significant storage and memory demands. These high demands make 3DGS impractical for mobile devices or headsets, reducing its applicability in important areas of computer graphics. To address these challenges and advance the practicality of 3DGS, this survey provides a comprehensive and detailed examination of compression and compaction techniques developed to make 3DGS more efficient. We classify existing methods into two categories: compression, which focuses on reducing file size, and compaction, which aims to minimize the number of Gaussians. Both methods aim to maintain or improve quality, each by minimizing its respective attribute: file size for compression and Gaussian count for compaction. We introduce the basic mathematical concepts underlying the analyzed methods, as well as key implementation details and design choices. Our report thoroughly discusses similarities and differences among the methods, as well as their respective advantages and disadvantages. We establish a consistent framework for comparing the surveyed methods based on key performance metrics and datasets.

A \"visual analogy\" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the \"what\" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the \"how\" and extrapolating this rule to new objects.

    "title": "Breaking Class Barriers: Efficient Dataset Distillation via Inter-Class Feature Compensator",
    "summary": "arXiv:2408.06927v3 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a technique aiming to condense informative features from large, natural datasets into a compact and synthetic form. While recent advancements have refined this technique, its performance is bottlenecked by the prevailing class-specific synthesis paradigm. Under this paradigm, synthetic data is optimized exclusively for a pre-assigned one-hot label, creating an implicit class barrier in feature condensation. This leads to inefficient utilization of the distillation budget and oversight of inter-class feature distributions, which ultimately limits the effectiveness and efficiency, as demonstrated in our analysis. To overcome these constraints, this paper presents the Inter-class Feature Compensator (INFER), an innovative distillation approach that transcends the class-specific data-label framework widely utilized in current dataset distillation methods. Specifically, INFER leverages a Universal Feature Compensator (UFC) to enhance feature integration across classes, enabling the generation of multiple additional synthetic instances from a single UFC input. This significantly improves the efficiency of the distillation budget. Moreover, INFER enriches inter-class interactions during the distillation, thereby enhancing the effectiveness and generalizability of the distilled data. By allowing for the linear interpolation of labels similar to those in the original dataset, INFER meticulously optimizes the synthetic data and dramatically reduces the size of soft labels in the synthetic dataset to almost zero, establishing a new benchmark for efficiency and effectiveness in dataset distillation. In practice, INFER demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across benchmark datasets. For instance, in the ipc = 50 setting on ImageNet-1k with the same compression level, it outperforms SRe2L by 34.5% using ResNet18.",

Despite their success, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods can only provide limited insights into dual-encoders since their predictions depend on feature-interactions rather than on individual features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to CLIP models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes also account for mismatches. This visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes and exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects.

With the growing demand of social robotics, near-field scene understanding becomes an important research topic in the areas of egocentric perceptual tasks related to navigation in both crowded and unstructured environments. Due to the complexity of environmental conditions and difficulty of surrounding obstacles owing to truncation and occlusion, the perception capability under this circumstance is still inferior. To further enhance the intelligence of mobile robots, in this paper, we setup an egocentric multi-sensor data collection platform based on 3 main types of sensors (Camera, LiDAR and Fisheye), which supports flexible sensor configurations to enable dynamic sight of view from ego-perspective, capturing either near or farther areas. Meanwhile, a large-scale multimodal dataset is constructed, named RoboSense, to facilitate egocentric robot perception. Specifically, RoboSense contains more than 133K synchronized data with 1.4M 3D bounding box and IDs annotated in the full $360^{\\circ}$ view, forming 216K trajectories across 7.6K temporal sequences. It has $270\\times$ and $18\\times$ as many annotations of surrounding obstacles within near ranges as the previous datasets collected for autonomous driving scenarios such as KITTI and nuScenes. Moreover, we define a novel matching criterion for near-field 3D perception and prediction metrics.

In this study, we introduce a novel approach to Human Action Recognition (HAR) using language supervision named LS-HAR based on skeleton and visual cues. Our method leverages a language model to guide the feature extraction process in the skeleton encoder. Specifically, we employ learnable prompts for the language model conditioned on the skeleton modality to optimize feature representation. Furthermore, we propose a fusion mechanism that combines dual-modality features using a salient fusion module, incorporating attention and transformer mechanisms to address the modalities' high dimensionality. This fusion process prioritizes informative video frames and body joints, enhancing the recognition accuracy of human actions. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset tailored for real-world robotic applications in construction sites, featuring visual, skeleton, and depth data modalities, named VolvoConstAct. This dataset serves to facilitate the training and evaluation of machine learning models to instruct autonomous construction machines for performing necessary tasks in real-world construction sites.

At the same time, Dense Training is widely accepted as being the \"de facto\" approach to train artificial neural networks if one would like to maximize their robustness against image corruption. In this paper, we question this general practice. Consequently, we claim that, contrary to what is commonly thought, the Dynamic Sparse Training methods can consistently outperform Dense Training in terms of robustness accuracy, particularly if the efficiency aspect is not considered as a main objective (i.e., sparsity levels between 10% and up to 50%), without adding (or even reducing) resource cost. We validate our claim on two types of data, images and videos, using several traditional and modern deep learning architectures for computer vision and three widely studied Dynamic Sparse Training algorithms. Our findings reveal a new yet-unknown benefit of Dynamic Sparse Training and open new possibilities in improving deep learning robustness beyond the current state of the art.",

While You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular real-time object detection algorithm, factors like training data quality and adverse weather conditions (e.g., heavy rain) can lead to detection failures. These failures can be particularly dangerous when visual similarities between objects exist, such as mistaking a 30 km/h sign for a higher speed limit sign. This paper proposes a method that combines video analysis and reasoning, prompting with a human-in-the-loop guide large vision model to improve YOLOs accuracy in detecting road speed limit signs, especially in semi-real-world conditions. It is hypothesized that the guided prompting and reasoning abilities of Video-LLava can enhance YOLOs traffic sign detection capabilities. This hypothesis is supported by an evaluation based on human-annotated accuracy metrics within a dataset of recorded videos from the CARLA car simulator. The results demonstrate that a collaborative approach combining YOLO with Video-LLava and reasoning can effectively address challenging situations such as heavy rain and overcast conditions that hinder YOLOs detection capabilities.",

Unfortunately, despite the remarkable efficacy of the CNN models in multi-scale object detection, CNN models often fail to detect smaller objects in images due to the loss of dense features during the pooling process. Atrous convolution addresses this issue by applying sparse kernels. However, sparse kernels often can lose the multi-scale detection efficacy of the CNN model. In this paper, we propose an object detection model using a Switchable (adaptive) Atrous Convolutional Network (SAC-Net) based on the efficientDet model. A fixed atrous rate limits the performance of the CNN models in the convolutional layers. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a switchable mechanism that allows for dynamically adjusting the atrous rate during the forward pass. The proposed SAC-Net encapsulates the benefits of both low-level and high-level features to achieve improved performance on multi-scale object detection tasks, without losing the dense features. Further, we apply a depth-wise switchable atrous rate to the proposed network, to improve the scale-invariant features. Finally, we apply global context on the proposed model. Our extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAC-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a significant margin in terms of accuracy.",

Recent studies tackle this problem by developing re-weighting and re-sampling methods, that utilise the class frequencies of the dataset. However, these techniques focus solely on the frequency statistics and ignore the distribution of the classes in image space, missing important information. In contrast to them, we propose FRActal CALibration (FRACAL): a novel post-calibration method for long-tailed object detection. FRACAL devises a logit adjustment method that utilises the fractal dimension to estimate how uniformly classes are distributed in image space. During inference, it uses the fractal dimension to inversely downweight the probabilities of uniformly spaced class predictions achieving balance in two axes: between frequent and rare categories, and between uniformly spaced and sparsely spaced classes. FRACAL is a post-processing method and it does not require any training, also it can be combined with many off-the-shelf models such as one-stage sigmoid detectors and two-stage instance segmentation models. FRACAL boosts the rare class performance by up to 8.6% and surpasses all previous methods on LVIS dataset, while showing good generalisation to other datasets such as COCO, V3Det and OpenImages.

However, these models typically rely on the predetermined denoising schedules for all prompts.

Therefore, diffusion models should reason for each instance to adaptively determine the optimal noise schedule, achieving high generation quality with sampling efficiency. In this paper, we introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) for this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step. We train the TPM using reinforcement learning to maximize a reward that encourages high final image quality while penalizing excessive denoising steps. With such an adaptive scheduler, TPDM not only generates high-quality images that are aligned closely with human preferences but also adjusts diffusion time and the number of denoising steps on the fly, enhancing both performance and efficiency. With Stable Diffusion 3 Medium architecture, TPDM achieves an aesthetic score of 5.44 and a human preference score (HPS) of 29.59, while using around 50% fewer denoising steps to achieve better performance.",

Existing studies train video quality assessment models that rely on human-annotated ratings for video evaluation but overlook the reasoning behind evaluations, limiting their ability to capture nuanced human criteria. Moreover, aligning T2V model using video-based human feedback remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes LiFT, the first method designed to leverage human feedback for T2V model alignment. Specifically, we first construct a Human Rating Annotation dataset, LiFT-HRA, consisting of approximately 10k human annotations, each including a score and its corresponding rationale. Based on this, we train a reward model LiFT-Critic to learn reward function effectively, which serves as a proxy for human judgment, measuring the alignment between given videos and human expectations. Lastly, we leverage the learned reward function to align the T2V model by maximizing the reward-weighted likelihood.

The ISM segments the input face into distinct source and target face information, and the SIRM reconstructs the source face and extracts latent target identity features with the segmented source information. The background context and latent target identity features are synergetically fused by a Masked Autoencoder in the TIRM to reconstruct the target face. We evaluate DFREC on six different high-fidelity face-swapping attacks on FaceForensics++, CelebaMegaFS and FFHQ-E4S datasets, which demonstrate its superior recovery performance over state-of-the-art deepfake recovery algorithms. In addition, DFREC is the only scheme that can recover both pristine source and target faces directly from the forgery image with high fadelity.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.09601v2 Announce Type: replace \nAbstract: Video temporal grounding aims to localize relevant temporal boundaries in a video given a textual prompt. Recent work has focused on enabling Video LLMs to perform video temporal grounding via next-token prediction of temporal timestamps. However, accurately localizing timestamps in videos remains challenging for Video LLMs when relying solely on temporal token prediction. Our proposed TimeRefine addresses this challenge in two ways. First, instead of directly predicting the start and end timestamps, we reformulate the temporal grounding task as a temporal refining task: the model first makes rough predictions and then refines them by predicting offsets to the target segment. This refining process is repeated multiple times, through which the model progressively self-improves its temporal localization accuracy. Second, to enhance the model's temporal perception capabilities, we incorporate an auxiliary prediction head that penalizes the model more if a predicted segment deviates further from the ground truth, thus encouraging the model to make closer and more accurate predictions. Our plug-and-play method can be integrated into most LLM-based temporal grounding approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeRefine achieves 3.6% and 5.0% mIoU improvements on the ActivityNet and Charades-STA datasets, respectively. Code and pretrained models will be released.",

Unfortunately, current artificial neural network (ANN)-based segmentation methods suffer from high computational demands, the requirements for image frames, and massive energy consumption, limiting their efficiency and application on resource-constrained edge/mobile platforms. To address these problems, we introduce SLTNet, a spike-driven lightweight transformer-based network designed for event-based semantic segmentation. Specifically, SLTNet is built on efficient spike-driven convolution blocks (SCBs) to extract rich semantic features while reducing the model's parameters. Then, to enhance the long-range contextural feature interaction, we propose novel spike-driven transformer blocks (STBs) with binary mask operations. Based on these basic blocks, SLTNet employs a high-efficiency single-branch architecture while maintaining the low energy consumption of the Spiking Neural Network (SNN). Finally, extensive experiments on DDD17 and DSEC-Semantic datasets demonstrate that SLTNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) SNN-based methods by at most 9.06% and 9.39% mIoU, respectively, with extremely 4.58x lower energy consumption and 114 FPS inference speed.

The rendering equation is the core of the two tasks, as an ideal conditional distribution transfer function from intrinsic properties to RGB images. Despite achieving promising results of existing rendering methods, they merely approximate the ideal estimation for a specific scene and come with a high computational cost. Additionally, the inverse conditional distribution transfer is intractable due to the inherent ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose a data-driven method that jointly models rendering and inverse rendering as two conditional generation tasks within a single diffusion framework. Inspired by UniDiffuser, we utilize two distinct time schedules to model both tasks, and with a tailored dual streaming module, we achieve cross-conditioning of two pre-trained diffusion models. This unified approach, named Uni-Renderer, allows the two processes to facilitate each other through a cycle-consistent constrain, mitigating ambiguity by enforcing consistency between intrinsic properties and rendered images. Combined with a meticulously prepared dataset, our method effectively decomposition of intrinsic properties and demonstrates a strong capability to recognize changes during rendering. We will open-source our training and inference code to the public, fostering further research and development in this area.",

However, we observe that little research has looked into how it works. In this work, we first visualize the similarity maps, which are obtained by computing the semantic similarity between the $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token and the image token embeddings derived from the last hidden layer in both the LLaVA encoder and SAM decoder. Intriguingly, we have found that a striking consistency holds in terms of activation responses in the similarity map,which reveals that what $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token contributes to is the semantic similarity within image-text pairs. Specifically, $\\texttt{<SEG>}$ token, a placeholder expanded in text vocabulary, extensively queries among individual tokenized image patches to match the semantics of an object from text to the paired image while the Large Language Models (LLMs) are being fine-tuned. Upon the above findings, we present READ, which facilitates LMMs' resilient $\\textbf{REA}$soning capability of where to atten$\\textbf{D}$ under the guidance of highly activated points borrowed from similarity maps.

In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Three novel components are also included: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space.

To solve this problem, this paper introduces ArtNVG, an innovative 3D stylization framework that efficiently generates stylized 3D scenes by leveraging reference style images. Built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), ArtNVG achieves rapid optimization and rendering while upholding high reconstruction quality. Our framework realizes high-quality 3D stylization by incorporating two pivotal techniques: Content-Style Separated Control and Attention-based Neighboring-View Alignment. Content-Style Separated Control uses the CSGO model and the Tile ControlNet to decouple the content and style control, reducing risks of information leakage.

We identify the key aspects of equivariant and non-equivariant architectures that drive success in different tasks by benchmarking them on segmentation, regression, and generation tasks across multiple datasets with increasing complexity.

Essentially, GCD needs to remember existing patterns thoroughly to recognize novel categories. Recent state-of-the-art method SimGCD transfers the knowledge from known-class data to the learning of novel classes through debiased learning. However, some patterns are catastrophically forgot during adaptation and thus lead to poor performance in novel categories classification. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning approach, LegoGCD, which is seamlessly integrated into previous methods to enhance the discrimination of novel classes while maintaining performance on previously encountered known classes. Specifically, we design two types of techniques termed as Local Entropy Regularization (LER) and Dual-views Kullback Leibler divergence constraint (DKL). The LER optimizes the distribution of potential known class samples in unlabeled data, thus ensuring the preservation of knowledge related to known categories while learning novel classes. Meanwhile, DKL introduces Kullback Leibler divergence to encourage the model to produce a similar prediction distribution of two view samples from the same image. In this way, it successfully avoids mismatched prediction and generates more reliable potential known class samples simultaneously. Extensive experiments validate that the proposed LegoGCD effectively addresses the known category forgetting issue across all datasets, eg, delivering a 7.74% and 2.51% accuracy boost on known and novel classes in CUB, respectively.

Our proposed approach integrates a human movement-based motion blur model into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly modeling human motion trajectories during exposure time, we jointly optimize the trajectories and 3D Gaussians to reconstruct sharp, high-quality human avatars. We employ a pose-dependent fusion mechanism to distinguish moving body regions, optimizing both blurred and sharp areas effectively.

Consequently, many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs.

Recent years have seen a substantial uptake in applying deep learning and computer vision to analyse and interpret medical images. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs), face significant computational challenges, prompting the need for architectural advancements. Recent efforts have led to the introduction of novel architectures like the ``Mamba'' model as alternative solutions to traditional CNNs or ViTs. The Mamba model excels in the linear processing of one-dimensional data with low computational demands. However, Mamba's potential for 3D medical image analysis remains underexplored and could face significant computational challenges as the dimension increases. This manuscript presents MobileViM, a streamlined architecture for efficient segmentation of 3D medical images.

MobileViM also features a cross-scale bridging technique to improve efficiency and accuracy across various medical imaging modalities. With these enhancements, MobileViM achieves segmentation speeds exceeding 90 frames per second (FPS) on a single graphics processing unit (i.e., NVIDIA RTX 4090). This performance is over 24 FPS faster than the state-of-the-art deep learning models for processing 3D images with the same computational resources.

LiDAR, as a commonly used sensor in cooperative perception, is widely equipped in intelligent vehicles and infrastructure. However, its superior performance comes with a correspondingly high cost. To achieve low-cost V2I, reducing the cost of LiDAR is crucial. Therefore, we study adopting low-resolution LiDAR on the vehicle to minimize cost as much as possible. However, simply reducing the resolution of vehicle's LiDAR results in sparse point clouds, making distant small objects even more blurred. Additionally, traditional communication methods have relatively low bandwidth utilization efficiency. These factors pose challenges for us. To balance cost and perceptual accuracy, we propose a new collaborative perception framework, namely LCV2I. LCV2I uses data collected from cameras and low-resolution LiDAR as input. It also employs feature offset correction modules and regional feature enhancement algorithms to improve feature representation. Finally, we use regional difference map and regional score map to assess the value of collaboration content, thereby improving communication bandwidth efficiency. In summary, our approach achieves high perceptual performance while substantially reducing the demand for high-resolution sensors on the vehicle.

Recently, DeepSDF has predominantly been used as a category-level shape prior, but it struggles to reconstruct sharp geometry and is computationally expensive. In contrast, NeRFs capture fine details but have yet to be effectively integrated with category-level priors in a real-time multi-object mapping framework. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRENOM, a Prior-based Efficient Neural Object Mapper that integrates category-level priors with object-level NeRFs to enhance reconstruction efficiency while enabling canonical object pose estimation. PRENOM gets to know objects on a first-name basis by meta-learning on synthetic reconstruction tasks generated from open-source shape datasets. To account for object category variations, it employs a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the NeRF architecture for each category, balancing reconstruction quality and training time. Additionally, prior-based probabilistic ray sampling directs sampling toward expected object regions, accelerating convergence and improving reconstruction quality under constrained resources. Experimental results on a low-end GPU highlight the ability of PRENOM to achieve high-quality reconstructions while maintaining computational feasibility. Specifically, comparisons with prior-free NeRF-based approaches on a synthetic dataset show a 21% lower Chamfer distance, demonstrating better reconstruction quality. Furthermore, evaluations against other approaches using shape priors on a noisy real-world dataset indicate a 13% improvement averaged across all reconstruction metrics, and comparable pose and size estimation accuracy, while being trained for 5x less time.",

While significant progress has been made in developing objective models to assess these dimensions, the performance of such models heavily relies on the scale and quality of human annotations. According to Scaling Law, increasing the number of human-labeled instances follows a predictable pattern that enhances the performance of evaluation models. Therefore, we introduce a comprehensive dataset designed to Evaluate Visual quality and Alignment Level for text-to-vision content (Q-EVAL-100K), featuring the largest collection of human-labeled Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) for the mentioned two aspects. The Q-EVAL-100K dataset encompasses both text-to-image and text-to-video models, with 960K human annotations specifically focused on visual quality and alignment for 100K instances (60K images and 40K videos). Leveraging this dataset with context prompt, we propose Q-Eval-Score, a unified model capable of evaluating both visual quality and alignment with special improvements for handling long-text prompt alignment. Experimental results indicate that the proposed Q-Eval-Score achieves superior performance on both visual quality and alignment, with strong generalization capabilities across other benchmarks. These findings highlight the significant value of the Q-EVAL-100K dataset. Data and codes will be available at https://github.com/zzc-1998/Q-Eval.",

However, due to the structural differences between CNN and Transformer architectures, simply applying binary CNN strategies to the ViT models will lead to a significant performance drop. To tackle this challenge, we propose BHViT, a binarization-friendly hybrid ViT architecture and its full binarization model with the guidance of three important observations. Initially, BHViT utilizes the local information interaction and hierarchical feature aggregation technique from coarse to fine levels to address redundant computations stemming from excessive tokens. Then, a novel module based on shift operations is proposed to enhance the performance of the binary Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) module without significantly increasing computational overhead. In addition, an innovative attention matrix binarization method based on quantization decomposition is proposed to evaluate the token's importance in the binarized attention matrix. Finally, we propose a regularization loss to address the inadequate optimization caused by the incompatibility between the weight oscillation in the binary layers and the Adam Optimizer.

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities.

Deducing whether a particular grasp will be successful from indirect measurements, such as vision, is therefore quite challenging, and direct sensing of contacts through touch sensing provides an appealing avenue toward more successful and consistent robotic grasping. However, in order to fully evaluate the value of touch sensing for grasp outcome prediction, we must understand how touch sensing can influence outcome prediction accuracy when combined with other modalities. Doing so using conventional model-based techniques is exceptionally difficult. In this work, we investigate the question of whether touch sensing aids in predicting grasp outcomes within a multimodal sensing framework that combines vision and touch. To that end, we collected more than 9,000 grasping trials using a two-finger gripper equipped with GelSight high-resolution tactile sensors on each finger, and evaluated visuo-tactile deep neural network models to directly predict grasp outcomes from either modality individually, and from both modalities together.

This transformation is mirrored by the evolution of robotic systems, where the ability to leverage vision to simulate and predict their own dynamics marks a leap towards autonomy and self-awareness. Humans utilize vision to record experiences and internally simulate potential actions. For example, we can imagine that, if we stand up and raise our arms, the body will form a T shape without physical movement. Similarly, simulation allows robots to plan and predict the outcomes of potential actions without execution. Here we introduce a self-supervised learning framework to enable robots to model and predict their morphology, kinematics and motor control using only brief raw video data, eliminating the need for extensive real-world data collection and kinematic priors. By observing their own movements, akin to humans watching their reflection in a mirror, robots learn an ability to simulate themselves and predict their spatial motion for various tasks. Our results demonstrate that this self-learned simulation not only enables accurate motion planning but also allows the robot to detect abnormalities and recover from damage.",

However, there exists a trade-off between scanning speed and image resolution. Compared with traditional raster scanning, rotational scanning provides good opportunities for fast PAM imaging by optimizing the scanning mechanism. Recently, there is a trend to incorporate deep learning into the scanning process to further increase the scanning speed.Yet, most such attempts are performed for raster scanning while those for rotational scanning are relatively rare. In this study, we propose a novel and well-performing super-resolution framework for rotational scanning-based PAM imaging. To eliminate adjacent rows' displacements due to subject motion or high-frequency scanning distortion,we introduce a registration module across odd and even rows in the preprocessing and incorporate displacement degradation in the training. Besides, gradient-based patch selection is proposed to increase the probability of blood vessel patches being selected for training. A Transformer-based network with a global receptive field is applied for better performance.

AFTNet can be readily used to solve image inverse problems in domain transformation, especially for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction and other applications. While conventional methods typically utilize magnitude images or treat the real and imaginary components of k-space data as separate channels, our approach directly processes raw k-space data in the frequency domain, utilizing complex-valued operations. This allows for a mapping between the frequency (k-space) and image domain to be determined through cross-domain learning. We show that AFTNet achieves superior accelerated MRI reconstruction compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to various tasks, such as denoised magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) reconstruction and datasets with various contrasts.

Previous works perform modelling by only the use of visual information, ignoring audio information. We argue that although AQA is highly dependent on visual information, the audio is useful complementary information for improving the score regression accuracy, especially for sports with background music, such as figure skating and rhythmic gymnastics. To leverage multimodal information for AQA, i.e., RGB, optical flow and audio information, we propose a Progressive Adaptive Multimodal Fusion Network (PAMFN) that separately models modality-specific information and mixed-modality information. Our model consists of with three modality-specific branches that independently explore modality-specific information and a mixed-modality branch that progressively aggregates the modality-specific information from the modality-specific branches. To build the bridge between modality-specific branches and the mixed-modality branch, three novel modules are proposed. First, a Modality-specific Feature Decoder module is designed to selectively transfer modality-specific information to the mixed-modality branch. Second, when exploring the interaction between modality-specific information, we argue that using an invariant multimodal fusion policy may lead to suboptimal results, so as to take the potential diversity in different parts of an action into consideration. Therefore, an Adaptive Fusion Module is proposed to learn adaptive multimodal fusion policies in different parts of an action. This module consists of several FusionNets for exploring different multimodal fusion strategies and a PolicyNet for deciding which FusionNets are enabled.

Contrastive learning offers an appealing solution for multimodal self-supervised learning. Indeed, by considering each modality as a different view of the same entity, it learns to align features of different modalities in a shared representation space. However, this approach is intrinsically limited as it only learns shared or redundant information between modalities, while multimodal interactions can arise in other ways. In this work, we introduce CoMM, a Contrastive MultiModal learning strategy that enables the communication between modalities in a single multimodal space. Instead of imposing cross- or intra- modality constraints, we propose to align multimodal representations by maximizing the mutual information between augmented versions of these multimodal features. Our theoretical analysis shows that shared, synergistic and unique terms of information naturally emerge from this formulation, allowing us to estimate multimodal interactions beyond redundancy. We test CoMM both in a controlled and in a series of real-world settings: in the former, we demonstrate that CoMM effectively captures redundant, unique and synergistic information between modalities.

In the context of PDE solvers, recent works have shown that Lie point symmetries can be a useful inductive bias for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) through data and loss augmentation. Despite this, directly enforcing equivariance within the model architecture for these problems remains elusive. This is because many PDEs admit non-compact symmetry groups, oftentimes not studied beyond their infinitesimal generators, making them incompatible with most existing equivariant architectures. In this work, we propose Lie aLgebrA Canonicalization (LieLAC), a novel approach that exploits only the action of infinitesimal generators of the symmetry group, circumventing the need for knowledge of the full group structure. To achieve this, we address existing theoretical issues in the canonicalization literature, establishing connections with frame averaging in the case of continuous non-compact groups. Operating within the framework of canonicalization, LieLAC can easily be integrated with unconstrained pre-trained models, transforming inputs to a canonical form before feeding them into the existing model, effectively aligning the input for model inference according to allowed symmetries. LieLAC utilizes standard Lie group descent schemes, achieving equivariance in pre-trained models.

They leverage diffusion sampling steps for inducing a data prior while using a measurement guidance gradient at each step to impose data consistency. For general inverse problems, approximations are needed when an unconditionally trained diffusion model is used since the measurement likelihood is intractable, leading to inaccurate posterior sampling. In other words, due to their approximations, these methods fail to preserve the generation process on the data manifold defined by the diffusion prior, leading to artifacts in applications such as image restoration. To enhance the performance and robustness of diffusion models in solving inverse problems, we propose Diffusion State-Guided Projected Gradient (DiffStateGrad), which projects the measurement gradient onto a subspace that is a low-rank approximation of an intermediate state of the diffusion process. DiffStateGrad, as a module, can be added to a wide range of diffusion-based inverse solvers to improve the preservation of the diffusion process on the prior manifold and filter out artifact-inducing components. We highlight that DiffStateGrad improves the robustness of diffusion models in terms of the choice of measurement guidance step size and noise while improving the worst-case performance.

Previous research has developed datasets of human motion in indoor scenes, but these are often limited in scale and lack the nuanced social navigation dynamics common in home environments. To address this, we present LocoVR, a dataset of 7000+ two-person trajectories captured in virtual reality from over 130 different indoor home environments. LocoVR provides accurate trajectory data and precise spatial information, along with rich examples of socially-motivated movement behaviors.

Some works attempted to solve MRI reconstruction with diffusion models, but these methods operate directly in pixel space, leading to higher computational costs for optimization and inference. Latent diffusion models, pre-trained on natural images with rich visual priors, are expected to solve the high computational cost problem in MRI reconstruction by operating in a lower-dimensional latent space. However, direct application to MRI reconstruction faces three key challenges: (1) absence of explicit control mechanisms for medical fidelity, (2) domain gap between natural images and MR physics, and (3) undefined data consistency in latent space. To address these challenges, a novel Latent Diffusion Prior-based undersampled MRI reconstruction (LDPM) method is proposed. Our LDPM framework addresses these challenges by: (1) a sketch-guided pipeline with a two-step reconstruction strategy, which balances perceptual quality and anatomical fidelity, (2) an MRI-optimized VAE (MR-VAE), which achieves an improvement of approximately 3.92 dB in PSNR for undersampled MRI reconstruction compared to that with SD-VAE \\cite{sd}, and (3) Dual-Stage Sampler, a modified version of spaced DDPM sampler, which enforces high-fidelity reconstruction in the latent space.

However, the lack of specific imaging techniques often compromises the accuracy of tumor segmentation during the imaging process. To address this issue, we introduce the XLSTM-HVED model. This model integrates a hetero-modal encoder-decoder framework with the Vision XLSTM module to reconstruct missing MRI modalities. By deeply fusing spatial and temporal features, it enhances tumor segmentation performance. The key innovation of our approach is the Self-Attention Variational Encoder (SAVE) module, which improves the integration of modal features. Additionally, it optimizes the interaction of features between segmentation and reconstruction tasks through the Squeeze-Fusion-Excitation Cross Awareness (SFECA) module. Our experiments using the BraTS 2024 dataset demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms existing advanced methods in handling cases where modalities are missing.

In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as \"find a person wearing black\". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, our method integrates pixel-wise vision-language features with curiosity-driven exploration. This approach enables robust navigation to human-instructed instances across diverse environments. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and evaluate its performance through comprehensive navigation tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments, spanning different scales and semantic complexities. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.",

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{CarPlanner}, a \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{a}uto-\\textbf{r}egressive \\textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan.

However, existing approaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete map, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To address the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan reconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly interacting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization, achieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction using only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction algorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages spatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even in weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction module tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized plane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem, thereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by leveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method supports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without redundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected datasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose estimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving real-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the floorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours to just 9.44 minutes.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.01776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions.

In the Planning stage, MoR generates textual planning graphs delineating the logic for answering queries. Following planning graphs, in the Reasoning stage, MoR interweaves structural traversal and textual matching to obtain candidates from TG-KBs. In the Organizing stage, MoR further reranks fetched candidates based on their structural trajectory.

However, the exact rewriting approach may often depend on the use case and application-specific tasks supported by the conversational assistant, among other constraints. In this paper, we systematically investigate two different approaches, denoted as rewriting and fusion, on two fundamentally different generation tasks, including a text-to-text generation task and a multimodal generative task that takes as input text and generates a visualization or data table that answers the user's question. Our results indicate that the specific rewriting or fusion approach highly depends on the underlying use case and generative task. In particular, we find that for a conversational question-answering assistant, the query rewriting approach performs best, whereas for a data analysis assistant that generates visualizations and data tables based on the user's conversation with the assistant, the fusion approach works best. Notably, we explore two datasets for the data analysis assistant use case, for short and long conversations, and we find that query fusion always performs better, whereas for the conversational text-based question-answering, the query rewrite approach performs best.",

However, their effectiveness in the medical domain, particularly for abnormality detection and localization within medical images, remains underexplored. A major challenge is the complex and abstract nature of medical terminology, which makes it difficult to directly associate pathological anomaly terms with their corresponding visual features. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to enhance VLM performance in medical abnormality detection and localization by leveraging decomposed medical knowledge. Instead of directly prompting models to recognize specific abnormalities, we focus on breaking down medical concepts into fundamental attributes and common visual patterns. This strategy promotes a stronger alignment between textual descriptions and visual features, improving both the recognition and localization of abnormalities in medical images.We evaluate our method on the 0.23B Florence-2 base model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance in abnormality grounding to significantly larger 7B LLaVA-based medical VLMs, despite being trained on only 1.5% of the data used for such models. Experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both known and previously unseen abnormalities, suggesting its strong generalization capabilities.",

Therefore, we investigate more diverse signals to capture comprehensive instruction-response pair characteristics and propose three foundational metrics that leverage Multi-LLM wisdom, informed by (1) diverse LLM responses and (2) reward model assessment. Building upon base metrics, we propose CrowdSelect, an integrated metric incorporating a clustering-based approach to maintain response diversity.

However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear.

In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.",

    "summary": "We present GEN3C, a generative video model with precise Camera Control and temporal 3D Consistency. Prior video models already generate realistic videos, but they tend to leverage little 3D information, leading to inconsistencies, such as objects popping in and out of existence. Camera control, if implemented at all, is imprecise, because camera parameters are mere inputs to the neural network which must then infer how the video depends on the camera. In contrast, GEN3C is guided by a 3D cache: point clouds obtained by predicting the pixel-wise depth of seed images or previously generated frames. When generating the next frames, GEN3C is conditioned on the 2D renderings of the 3D cache with the new camera trajectory provided by the user. Crucially, this means that GEN3C neither has to remember what it previously generated nor does it have to infer the image structure from the camera pose. The model, instead, can focus all its generative power on previously unobserved regions, as well as advancing the scene state to the next frame. Our results demonstrate more precise camera control than prior work, as well as state-of-the-art results in sparse-view novel view synthesis, even in challenging settings such as driving scenes and monocular dynamic video.

    "title": "Babel: Open Multilingual Large Language Models Serving Over 90% of Global Speakers",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP), yet open-source multilingual LLMs remain scarce, with existing models often limited in language coverage. Such models typically prioritize well-resourced languages, while widely spoken but under-resourced languages are often overlooked. To address this disparity, we introduce Babel, an open multilingual LLM that covers the top 25 languages by number of speakers, supports over 90% of the global population, and includes many languages neglected by other open multilingual LLMs. Unlike traditional continue pretraining approaches, Babel expands its parameter count through a layer extension technique that elevates Babel's performance ceiling. We introduce two variants: Babel-9B, designed for efficient inference and fine-tuning, and Babel-83B, which sets a new standard for open multilingual LLMs. Extensive evaluations on multilingual tasks demonstrate its superior performance compared to open LLMs of comparable size. In addition, using open-source supervised fine-tuning datasets, Babel achieves remarkable performance, with Babel-9B-Chat leading among 10B-sized LLMs and Babel-83B-Chat setting a new standard for multilingual tasks, reaching the same level of commercial models.",

    "title": "Interact, Instruct to Improve: A LLM-Driven Parallel Actor-Reasoner Framework for Enhancing Autonomous Vehicle Interactions",
    "summary": "Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) have entered the commercialization stage, but their limited ability to interact and express intentions still poses challenges in interactions with Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable bidirectional human-machine communication, but the conflict between slow inference speed and the need for real-time decision-making challenges practical deployment. To address these issues, this paper introduces a parallel Actor-Reasoner framework designed to enable explicit bidirectional AV-HV interactions across multiple scenarios. First, by facilitating interactions between the LLM-driven Reasoner and heterogeneous simulated HVs during training, an interaction memory database, referred to as the Actor, is established. Then, by introducing the memory partition module and the two-layer memory retrieval module, the Actor's ability to handle heterogeneous HVs is significantly enhanced. Ablation studies and comparisons with other decision-making methods demonstrate that the proposed Actor-Reasoner framework significantly improves safety and efficiency. Finally, with the combination of the external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) information derived from Reasoner's reasoning and the feasible action solutions retrieved from the Actor, the effectiveness of the proposed Actor-Reasoner is confirmed in multi-scenario field interactions. Our code is available at https://github.com/FanGShiYuu/Actor-Reasoner.",

    "title": "ABC: Achieving Better Control of Multimodal Embeddings using VLMs",
    "summary": "Visual embedding models excel at zero-shot tasks like visual retrieval and classification. However, these models cannot be used for tasks that contain ambiguity or require user instruction. These tasks necessitate a multimodal embedding model, which outputs embeddings that combine visual and natural language input. Existing CLIP-based approaches embed images and text independently, and fuse the result. We find that this results in weak interactions between modalities, and poor user control over the representation. We introduce ABC, an open-source multimodal embedding model that uses a vision-language model backbone to deeply integrate image features with natural language instructions. ABC achieves bestfor-size performance on MSCOCO image-to-text retrieval and is the top performing model on classification and VQA tasks in the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark. With a strongly unified vision-language representation, ABC can use natural language to solve subtle and potentially ambiguous visual retrieval problems. To evaluate this capability, we design CtrlBench, a benchmark that requires interleaving textual instructions with image content for correct retrieval. ABC advances the state of multimodal embeddings by offering high-quality representations and flexible natural language control. Our model and datasets are available at our project page.",

    "title": "KodCode: A Diverse, Challenging, and Verifiable Synthetic Dataset for Coding",
    "summary": "We introduce KodCode, a synthetic dataset that addresses the persistent challenge of acquiring high-quality, verifiable training data across diverse difficulties and domains for training Large Language Models for coding. Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning. Fine-tuning experiments on coding benchmarks (HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that KodCode-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.",
