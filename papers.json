    "summary": "The recent rise in the popularity of large language models has spurred the development of extensive code datasets needed to train them. This has left limited code available for collection and use in the downstream investigation of specific behaviors, or evaluation of large language models without suffering from data contamination. To address this problem, we release The Heap, a large multilingual dataset covering 57 programming languages that has been deduplicated with respect to other open datasets of code, enabling researchers to conduct fair evaluations of large language models without significant data cleaning overhead.",

    "title": "Do generative video models learn physical principles from watching videos?",
    "summary": "AI video generation is undergoing a revolution, with quality and realism advancing rapidly. These advances have led to a passionate scientific debate: Do video models learn ``world models'' that discover laws of physics -- or, alternatively, are they merely sophisticated pixel predictors that achieve visual realism without understanding the physical principles of reality? We address this question by developing Physics-IQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that can only be solved by acquiring a deep understanding of various physical principles, like fluid dynamics, optics, solid mechanics, magnetism and thermodynamics. We find that across a range of current models (Sora, Runway, Pika, Lumiere, Stable Video Diffusion, and VideoPoet), physical understanding is severely limited, and unrelated to visual realism. At the same time, some test cases can already be successfully solved. This indicates that acquiring certain physical principles from observation alone may be possible, but significant challenges remain. While we expect rapid advances ahead, our work demonstrates that visual realism does not imply physical understanding.

    "title": "OmniThink: Expanding Knowledge Boundaries in Machine Writing through Thinking",
    "summary": "Machine writing with large language models often relies on retrieval-augmented generation. However, these approaches remain confined within the boundaries of the model's predefined scope, limiting the generation of content with rich information. Specifically, vanilla-retrieved information tends to lack depth, utility, and suffers from redundancy, which negatively impacts the quality of generated articles, leading to shallow, repetitive, and unoriginal outputs. To address these issues, we propose OmniThink, a machine writing framework that emulates the human-like process of iterative expansion and reflection. The core idea behind OmniThink is to simulate the cognitive behavior of learners as they progressively deepen their knowledge of the topics. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniThink improves the knowledge density of generated articles without compromising metrics such as coherence and depth. Human evaluations and expert feedback further highlight the potential of OmniThink to address real-world challenges in the generation of long-form articles.",

    "title": "Exploring the Inquiry-Diagnosis Relationship with Advanced Patient Simulators",
    "summary": "Online medical consultation (OMC) restricts doctors to gathering patient information solely through inquiries, making the already complex sequential decision-making process of diagnosis even more challenging. Recently, the rapid advancement of large language models has demonstrated a significant potential to transform OMC. However, most studies have primarily focused on improving diagnostic accuracy under conditions of relatively sufficient information, while paying limited attention to the \"inquiry\" phase of the consultation process. This lack of focus has left the relationship between \"inquiry\" and \"diagnosis\" insufficiently explored. In this paper, we first extract real patient interaction strategies from authentic doctor-patient conversations and use these strategies to guide the training of a patient simulator that closely mirrors real-world behavior. By inputting medical records into our patient simulator to simulate patient responses, we conduct extensive experiments to explore the relationship between \"inquiry\" and \"diagnosis\" in the consultation process. Experimental results demonstrate that inquiry and diagnosis adhere to the Liebig's law: poor inquiry quality limits the effectiveness of diagnosis, regardless of diagnostic capability, and vice versa. Furthermore, the experiments reveal significant differences in the inquiry performance of various models. To investigate this phenomenon, we categorize the inquiry process into four types: (1) chief complaint inquiry; (2) specification of known symptoms; (3) inquiry about accompanying symptoms; and (4) gathering family or medical history. We analyze the distribution of inquiries across the four types for different models to explore the reasons behind their significant performance differences. We plan to open-source the weights and related code of our patient simulator at https://github.com/LIO-H-ZEN/PatientSimulator.",

    "summary": "We introduce SynthLight, a diffusion model for portrait relighting. Our approach frames image relighting as a re-rendering problem, where pixels are transformed in response to changes in environmental lighting conditions. Using a physically-based rendering engine, we synthesize a dataset to simulate this lighting-conditioned transformation with 3D head assets under varying lighting. We propose two training and inference strategies to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real image domains: (1) multi-task training that takes advantage of real human portraits without lighting labels; (2) an inference time diffusion sampling procedure based on classifier-free guidance that leverages the input portrait to better preserve details. Our method generalizes to diverse real photographs and produces realistic illumination effects, including specular highlights and cast shadows, while preserving the subject's identity. Our quantitative experiments on Light Stage data demonstrate results comparable to state-of-the-art relighting methods. Our qualitative results on in-the-wild images showcase rich and unprecedented illumination effects. Project Page: https://vrroom.github.io/synthlight/",

    "title": "FAST: Efficient Action Tokenization for Vision-Language-Action Models",
    "summary": "Autoregressive sequence models, such as Transformer-based vision-language action (VLA) policies, can be tremendously effective for capturing complex and generalizable robotic behaviors. However, such models require us to choose a tokenization of our continuous action signals, which determines how the discrete symbols predicted by the model map to continuous robot actions. We find that current approaches for robot action tokenization, based on simple per-dimension, per-timestep binning schemes, typically perform poorly when learning dexterous skills from high-frequency robot data. To address this challenge, we propose a new compression-based tokenization scheme for robot actions, based on the discrete cosine transform. Our tokenization approach, Frequency-space Action Sequence Tokenization (FAST), enables us to train autoregressive VLAs for highly dexterous and high-frequency tasks where standard discretization methods fail completely. Based on FAST, we release FAST+, a universal robot action tokenizer, trained on 1M real robot action trajectories. It can be used as a black-box tokenizer for a wide range of robot action sequences, with diverse action spaces and control frequencies. Finally, we show that, when combined with the pi0 VLA, our method can scale to training on 10k hours of robot data and match the performance of diffusion VLAs, while reducing training time by up to 5x.",

    "summary": "Recently, large-scale generative models have demonstrated outstanding text-to-image generation capabilities. However, generating high-fidelity personalized images with specific subjects still presents challenges, especially in cases involving multiple subjects. In this paper, we propose AnyStory, a unified approach for personalized subject generation. AnyStory not only achieves high-fidelity personalization for single subjects, but also for multiple subjects, without sacrificing subject fidelity. Specifically, AnyStory models the subject personalization problem in an \"encode-then-route\" manner. In the encoding step, AnyStory utilizes a universal and powerful image encoder, i.e., ReferenceNet, in conjunction with CLIP vision encoder to achieve high-fidelity encoding of subject features. In the routing step, AnyStory utilizes a decoupled instance-aware subject router to accurately perceive and predict the potential location of the corresponding subject in the latent space, and guide the injection of subject conditions. Detailed experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our method in retaining subject details, aligning text descriptions, and personalizing for multiple subjects.

    "title": "CaPa: Carve-n-Paint Synthesis for Efficient 4K Textured Mesh Generation",
    "summary": "The synthesis of high-quality 3D assets from textual or visual inputs has become a central objective in modern generative modeling. Despite the proliferation of 3D generation algorithms, they frequently grapple with challenges such as multi-view inconsistency, slow generation times, low fidelity, and surface reconstruction problems. While some studies have addressed some of these issues, a comprehensive solution remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce CaPa, a carve-and-paint framework that generates high-fidelity 3D assets efficiently. CaPa employs a two-stage process, decoupling geometry generation from texture synthesis. Initially, a 3D latent diffusion model generates geometry guided by multi-view inputs, ensuring structural consistency across perspectives. Subsequently, leveraging a novel, model-agnostic Spatially Decoupled Attention, the framework synthesizes high-resolution textures (up to 4K) for a given geometry. Furthermore, we propose a 3D-aware occlusion inpainting algorithm that fills untextured regions, resulting in cohesive results across the entire model. This pipeline generates high-quality 3D assets in less than 30 seconds, providing ready-to-use outputs for commercial applications. Experimental results demonstrate that CaPa excels in both texture fidelity and geometric stability, establishing a new standard for practical, scalable 3D asset generation.",

    "title": "Learnings from Scaling Visual Tokenizers for Reconstruction and Generation",
    "summary": "Visual tokenization via auto-encoding empowers state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space. Although scaling Transformer-based generators has been central to recent advances, the tokenizer component itself is rarely scaled, leaving open questions about how auto-encoder design choices influence both its objective of reconstruction and downstream generative performance. Our work aims to conduct an exploration of scaling in auto-encoders to fill in this blank. To facilitate this exploration, we replace the typical convolutional backbone with an enhanced Vision Transformer architecture for Tokenization (ViTok). We train ViTok on large-scale image and video datasets far exceeding ImageNet-1K, removing data constraints on tokenizer scaling. We first study how scaling the auto-encoder bottleneck affects both reconstruction and generation -- and find that while it is highly correlated with reconstruction, its relationship with generation is more complex. We next explored the effect of separately scaling the auto-encoders' encoder and decoder on reconstruction and generation performance. Crucially, we find that scaling the encoder yields minimal gains for either reconstruction or generation, while scaling the decoder boosts reconstruction but the benefits for generation are mixed. Building on our exploration, we design ViTok as a lightweight auto-encoder that achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art auto-encoders on ImageNet-1K and COCO reconstruction tasks (256p and 512p) while outperforming existing auto-encoders on 16-frame 128p video reconstruction for UCF-101, all with 2-5x fewer FLOPs. When integrated with Diffusion Transformers, ViTok demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks for class-conditional video generation on UCF-101.",

    "title": "Inference-Time Scaling for Diffusion Models beyond Scaling Denoising Steps",
    "summary": "Generative models have made significant impacts across various domains, largely due to their ability to scale during training by increasing data, computational resources, and model size, a phenomenon characterized by the scaling laws. Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs), revealing how performance can further improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs, diffusion models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation via the number of denoising steps, although the performance gains typically flatten after a few dozen. In this work, we explore the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically, we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback, and the algorithms used to find better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks, our findings reveal that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the quality of samples generated by diffusion models, and with the complicated nature of images, combinations of the components in the framework can be specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.",

    "title": "Towards Large Reasoning Models: A Survey of Reinforced Reasoning with Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Language has long been conceived as an essential tool for human reasoning. The breakthrough of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked significant research interest in leveraging these models to tackle complex reasoning tasks. Researchers have moved beyond simple autoregressive token generation by introducing the concept of \"thought\" -- a sequence of tokens representing intermediate steps in the reasoning process. This innovative paradigm enables LLMs' to mimic complex human reasoning processes, such as tree search and reflective thinking. Recently, an emerging trend of learning to reason has applied reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to master reasoning processes. This approach enables the automatic generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories through trial-and-error search algorithms, significantly expanding LLMs' reasoning capacity by providing substantially more training data. Furthermore, recent studies demonstrate that encouraging LLMs to \"think\" with more tokens during test-time inference can further significantly boost reasoning accuracy. Therefore, the train-time and test-time scaling combined to show a new research frontier -- a path toward Large Reasoning Model. The introduction of OpenAI's o1 series marks a significant milestone in this research direction. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of recent progress in LLM reasoning. We begin by introducing the foundational background of LLMs and then explore the key technical components driving the development of large reasoning models, with a focus on automated data construction, learning-to-reason techniques, and test-time scaling. We also analyze popular open-source projects at building large reasoning models, and conclude with open challenges and future research directions.",

    "title": "RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation",
    "summary": "Generative AI systems like foundation models (FMs) must align well with human values to ensure their behavior is helpful and trustworthy. While Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream impact of an interaction on users' utility. We demonstrate that feedback based on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on hindsight feedback. Our theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment algorithm, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation (RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. We apply RLHS to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods -- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) -- and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both methods. Through an online human user study, we show that RLHS consistently outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.",
