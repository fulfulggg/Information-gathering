    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22698v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Assessing the quality of public transportation services requires the analysis of large quantities of data on the scheduled and actual trips and documents listing the quality constraints each service needs to meet. Interrogating such datasets with SQL queries, organizing and visualizing the data can be quite complex for most users. This paper presents a chatbot offering a user-friendly tool to interact with these datasets and support decision making. It is based on an agent architecture, which expands the capabilities of the core Large Language Model (LLM) by allowing it to interact with a series of tools that can execute several tasks, like performing SQL queries, plotting data and creating maps from the coordinates of a trip and its stops. This paper also tackles one of the main open problems of such Generative AI projects: collecting data to measure the system's performance. Our chatbot has been extensively tested with a workflow that asks several questions and stores the generated query, the retrieved data and the natural language response for each of them. Such questions are drawn from a set of base examples which are then completed with actual data from the database. This procedure yields a dataset for the evaluation of the chatbot's performance, especially the consistency of its answers and the correctness of the generated queries.",

In MAPF, a team of agents must move to their goal locations without collisions, whereas in LMAPF, new goals are generated upon arrival. We propose methods for incorporating APFs in a range of MAPF algorithms, including Prioritized Planning, MAPF-LNS2, and Priority Inheritance with Backtracking (PIBT).

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22756v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Mathematical reasoning tasks have become prominent benchmarks for assessing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, especially with reinforcement learning (RL) methods such as GRPO showing significant performance gains. However, accuracy metrics alone do not support fine-grained assessment of capabilities and fail to reveal which problem-solving skills have been internalized. To better understand these capabilities, we propose to decompose problem solving into fundamental capabilities: Plan (mapping questions to sequences of steps), Execute (correctly performing solution steps), and Verify (identifying the correctness of a solution). Empirically, we find that GRPO mainly enhances the execution skill-improving execution robustness on problems the model already knows how to solve-a phenomenon we call temperature distillation. More importantly, we show that RL-trained models struggle with fundamentally new problems, hitting a 'coverage wall' due to insufficient planning skills. To explore RL's impact more deeply, we construct a minimal, synthetic solution-tree navigation task as an analogy for mathematical problem-solving. This controlled setup replicates our empirical findings, confirming RL primarily boosts execution robustness. Importantly, in this setting, we identify conditions under which RL can potentially overcome the coverage wall through improved exploration and generalization to new solution paths. Our findings provide insights into the role of RL in enhancing LLM reasoning, expose key limitations, and suggest a path toward overcoming these barriers.

This study proposes a hybrid approach by leveraging smartphone sensor data measuring daily physical activities and analyzing their social media (Twitter) interactions for evaluating an individual's depression level. Using CNN-based deep learning models and Naive Bayes classification, we identify human physical activities accurately and also classify the user sentiments. A total of 33 participants were recruited for data acquisition, and nine relevant features were extracted from the physical activities and analyzed with their weekly depression scores, evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) questionnaire. Of the nine features, six are derived from physical activities, achieving an activity recognition accuracy of 95%, while three features stem from sentiment analysis of Twitter activities, yielding a sentiment analysis accuracy of 95.6%. Notably, several physical activity features exhibited significant correlations with the severity of depression symptoms. For classifying the depression severity, a support vector machine (SVM)-based algorithm is employed that demonstrated a very high accuracy of 94%, outperforming alternative models, e.g., the multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor. It is a simple approach yet highly effective in the long run for monitoring depression without breaching personal privacy.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22928v1 Announce Type: new \nAbstract: Systematic reviews in medicine play a critical role in evidence-based decision-making by aggregating findings from multiple studies. A central bottleneck in automating this process is extracting numeric evidence and determining study-level conclusions for specific outcomes and comparisons. Prior work has framed this problem as a textual inference task by retrieving relevant content fragments and inferring conclusions from them. However, such approaches often rely on shallow textual cues and fail to capture the underlying numeric reasoning behind expert assessments.\n  In this work, we conceptualise the problem as one of quantitative reasoning. Rather than inferring conclusions from surface text, we extract structured numerical evidence (e.g., event counts or standard deviations) and apply domain knowledge informed logic to derive outcome-specific conclusions. We develop a numeric reasoning system composed of a numeric data extraction model and an effect estimate component, enabling more accurate and interpretable inference aligned with the domain expert principles. We train the numeric data extraction model using different strategies, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) with a new value reward model.\n  When evaluated on the CochraneForest benchmark, our best-performing approach -- using RL to train a small-scale number extraction model -- yields up to a 21% absolute improvement in F1 score over retrieval-based systems and outperforms general-purpose LLMs of over 400B parameters by up to 9%. Our results demonstrate the promise of reasoning-driven approaches for automating systematic evidence synthesis.",

By exploiting the chemical knowledge of an MMFM, FMG renders molecules as images, describes them as text, and aligns information across modalities using prompt learning. FMG can be used as a drop-in replacement for the prior grammar learning approaches in molecular generation and property prediction.

The advance of AI could itself be automated. If done safely, that would accelerate AI development and allow us to reap its benefits much sooner. Meta-learning can automate the discovery of novel algorithms, but is limited by first-order improvements and the human design of a suitable search space. The G\\\"odel machine proposed a theoretical alternative: a self-improving AI that repeatedly modifies itself in a provably beneficial manner. Unfortunately, proving that most changes are net beneficial is impossible in practice. We introduce the Darwin G\\\"odel Machine (DGM), a self-improving system that iteratively modifies its own code (thereby also improving its ability to modify its own codebase) and empirically validates each change using coding benchmarks. Inspired by Darwinian evolution and open-endedness research, the DGM maintains an archive of generated coding agents. It grows the archive by sampling an agent from it and using a foundation model to create a new, interesting, version of the sampled agent. This open-ended exploration forms a growing tree of diverse, high-quality agents and allows the parallel exploration of many different paths through the search space. Empirically, the DGM automatically improves its coding capabilities (e.g., better code editing tools, long-context window management, peer-review mechanisms), increasing performance on SWE-bench from 20.0% to 50.0%, and on Polyglot from 14.2% to 30.7%. Furthermore, the DGM significantly outperforms baselines without self-improvement or open-ended exploration. All experiments were done with safety precautions (e.g., sandboxing, human oversight). The DGM is a significant step toward self-improving AI, capable of gathering its own stepping stones along paths that unfold into endless innovation.",

These multi-agent debate (MAD) approaches, where agents collaboratively present, critique, and refine arguments, potentially offer improved reasoning, robustness, and diverse perspectives over monolithic models. Despite prior studies leveraging MAD, a systematic understanding of its effectiveness compared to self-agent methods, particularly under varying conditions, remains elusive. This paper seeks to fill this gap by conceptualizing MAD as a test-time computational scaling technique, distinguished by collaborative refinement and diverse exploration capabilities. We conduct a comprehensive empirical investigation comparing MAD with strong self-agent test-time scaling baselines on mathematical reasoning and safety-related tasks. Our study systematically examines the influence of task difficulty, model scale, and agent diversity on MAD's performance. Key findings reveal that, for mathematical reasoning, MAD offers limited advantages over self-agent scaling but becomes more effective with increased problem difficulty and decreased model capability, while agent diversity shows little benefit. Conversely, for safety tasks, MAD's collaborative refinement can increase vulnerability, but incorporating diverse agent configurations facilitates a gradual reduction in attack success through the collaborative refinement process. We believe our findings provide critical guidance for the future development of more effective and strategically deployed MAD systems.",

Those debates drew from mid-20th century ideas such as bounded rationality, which challenged more idealized notions of rationality observed since the 19th century. Now that 21st century cognitive scientists are applying the resulting dual process theories to artificial intelligence, it is time to dust off some lessons from this history. So this paper synthesizes old ideas with recent results from experiments on humans and machines. The result is Strategic Reflectivism, which takes the position that one key to intelligent systems (human or artificial) is pragmatic switching between intuitive and reflective inference to optimally fulfill competing goals. Strategic Reflectivism builds on American Pragmatism, transcends superficial indicators of reflective thinking such as model size or chains of thought, and becomes increasingly actionable as we learn more about the value of intuition and reflection.",

CBR-DDI constructs a knowledge repository by leveraging LLMs to extract pharmacological insights and graph neural networks (GNNs) to model drug associations.

However, extending these achievements to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) presents critical challenges, which are frequently more pronounced for Multimodal Small Language Models (MSLMs) given their typically weaker foundational reasoning abilities: (1) the scarcity of high-quality multimodal reasoning datasets, (2) the degradation of reasoning capabilities due to the integration of visual processing, and (3) the risk that direct application of reinforcement learning may produce complex yet incorrect reasoning processes.

To address this, we introduce MathArena, a new benchmark based on the following key insight: recurring math competitions provide a stream of high-quality, challenging problems that can be used for real-time evaluation of LLMs. By evaluating models as soon as new problems are released, we effectively eliminate the risk of contamination. Using this framework, we find strong signs of contamination in AIME 2024. Nonetheless, evaluations on harder competitions, such as SMT 2025 -- published well after model release dates -- demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities in top-performing models. MathArena is also the first benchmark for proof-writing capabilities. On USAMO 2025, even top models score below 25%, far behind their performance on final-answer tasks.

Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity, criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration. To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions, including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident response. The proposed framework differentiates itself from previous research by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a fine-tuned LLM-based SOC assistant. The AI-Avatar case study illustrates human-AI collaboration for SOC tasks, reducing alert fatigue, enhancing response coordination, and strategically calibrating trust.

Experiments on four challenging benchmarks--MMMU, MMBench, MVBench, and V*Bench--demonstrate that GAM-Agent significantly improves performance across various VLM backbones. Notably, GAM-Agent boosts the accuracy of small-to-mid scale models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B, InternVL3-14B) by 5--6\\%, and still enhances strong models like GPT-4o by up to 2--3\\%. Our approach is modular, scalable, and generalizable, offering a path toward reliable and explainable multi-agent multimodal reasoning.",

We present a mathematical framework that models jobs, workers, and worker-job fit, introducing a novel decomposition of skills into decision-level and action-level subskills to reflect the complementary strengths of humans and GenAI. We analyze how changes in subskill abilities affect job success, identifying conditions for sharp transitions in success probability. We also establish sufficient conditions under which combining workers with complementary subskills significantly outperforms relying on a single worker. This explains phenomena such as productivity compression, where GenAI assistance yields larger gains for lower-skilled workers. We demonstrate the framework' s practicality using data from O*NET and Big-Bench Lite, aligning real-world data with our model via subskill-division methods. Our results highlight when and how GenAI complements human skills, rather than replacing them.",

When such problems have resource or failure constraints where action sequences may be forcibly terminated once resources are exhausted, agents face implicit trade-offs that reshape their utility-driven (rational) behaviour. Additionally, since these agents are typically commissioned by a human principal to act on their behalf, asymmetries in constraint exposure can give rise to previously unanticipated misalignment between human objectives and agent incentives. We formalise this setting through a survival bandit framework, provide theoretical and empirical results that quantify the impact of survival-driven preference shifts, identify conditions under which misalignment emerges and propose mechanisms to mitigate the emergence of risk-seeking or risk-averse behaviours. As a result, this work aims to increase understanding and interpretability of emergent behaviours of AI agents operating under such survival pressure, and offer guidelines for safely deploying such AI systems in critical resource-limited environments.",

Collecting such instructions is crucial for evaluating and mitigating over-refusals, but existing instruction curation methods, like manual creation or instruction rewriting, either lack scalability or fail to produce sufficiently diverse and effective refusal-inducing prompts. To address these limitations, we introduce EVOREFUSE, a prompt optimization approach that generates diverse pseudo-malicious instructions consistently eliciting confident refusals across LLMs. EVOREFUSE employs an evolutionary algorithm exploring the instruction space in more diverse directions than existing methods via mutation strategies and recombination, and iteratively evolves seed instructions to maximize evidence lower bound on LLM refusal probability. Using EVOREFUSE, we create two novel datasets: EVOREFUSE-TEST, a benchmark of 582 pseudo-malicious instructions that outperforms the next-best benchmark with 140.41% higher average refusal triggering rate across 9 LLMs, 34.86% greater lexical diversity, and 40.03% improved LLM response confidence scores; and EVOREFUSE-ALIGN, which provides 3,000 pseudo-malicious instructions with responses for supervised and preference-based alignment training. LLAMA3.1-8B-INSTRUCT supervisedly fine-tuned on EVOREFUSE-ALIGN achieves up to 14.31% fewer over-refusals than models trained on the second-best alignment dataset, without compromising safety.

In real-world scenarios, LLMs may apply various reasoning patterns (e.g., decomposition) to solve a problem, potentially suffering from errors under various reasoning patterns. Therefore, PRMs are required to identify errors under various reasoning patterns during the reasoning process. However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on evaluating PRMs with stepwise correctness, ignoring a systematic evaluation of PRMs under various reasoning patterns. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Socratic-PRMBench, a new benchmark to evaluate PRMs systematically under six reasoning patterns, including Transformation, Decomposition, Regather, Deduction, Verification, and Integration. Socratic-PRMBench}comprises 2995 reasoning paths with flaws within the aforementioned six reasoning patterns. Through our experiments on both PRMs and LLMs prompted as critic models, we identify notable deficiencies in existing PRMs. These observations underscore the significant weakness of current PRMs in conducting evaluations on reasoning steps under various reasoning patterns. We hope Socratic-PRMBench can serve as a comprehensive testbed for systematic evaluation of PRMs under diverse reasoning patterns and pave the way for future development of PRMs.",

Existing adversarial attacks typically rely on visible pixel perturbations or require privileged model or environment access, making them impractical for stealthy, real-world exploitation. We introduce TRAP, a generative adversarial framework that manipulates the agent's decision-making using diffusion-based semantic injections. Our method combines negative prompt-based degradation with positive semantic optimization, guided by a Siamese semantic network and layout-aware spatial masking. Without requiring access to model internals, TRAP produces visually natural images yet induces consistent selection biases in agentic AI systems. We evaluate TRAP on the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset, building multi-candidate decision scenarios. Across these scenarios, TRAP achieves a 100% attack success rate on leading models, including LLaVA-34B, Gemma3, and Mistral-3.1, significantly outperforming baselines such as SPSA, Bandit, and standard diffusion approaches.

Previous research suggests that people can discover new planning strategies through learning from reinforcements, a process known as metacognitive reinforcement learning (MCRL). While prior work has shown that MCRL models can learn new planning strategies and explain more participants' experience-driven discovery better than alternative mechanisms, it also revealed significant individual differences in metacognitive learning. Furthermore, when fitted to human data, these models exhibit a slower rate of strategy discovery than humans. In this study, we investigate whether incorporating cognitive mechanisms that might facilitate human strategy discovery can bring models of MCRL closer to human performance. Specifically, we consider intrinsically generated metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort valuation, and termination deliberation. Analysis of planning task data shows that a larger proportion of participants used at least one of these mechanisms, with significant individual differences in their usage and varying impacts on strategy discovery. Metacognitive pseudo-rewards, subjective effort valuation, and learning the value of acting without further planning were found to facilitate strategy discovery. While these enhancements provided valuable insights into individual differences and the effect of these mechanisms on strategy discovery, they did not fully close the gap between model and human performance, prompting further exploration of additional factors that people might use to discover new planning strategies.",

So far, after discovering the model, there is no technique that enables the synchronized abstraction of the underlying event log. This results in loosing the grounding in the real-world behavior contained in the log and, in turn, restricts analysis insights. Hence, in this work, we provide the formal basis for synchronized model and event abstraction, i.e., we prove that abstracting a process model by MA and discovering a process model from an abstracted event log yields an equivalent process model. We prove the feasibility of our approach based on behavioral profile abstraction as non-order preserving MA technique, resulting in a novel EA technique.",

As a potential mitigation, we investigate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring, wherein a weaker trusted monitor model continuously oversees the intermediate reasoning steps of a more powerful but untrusted model. We compare CoT monitoring to action-only monitoring, where only final outputs are reviewed, in a red-teaming setup where the untrusted model is instructed to pursue harmful side tasks while completing a coding problem. We find that CoT monitoring improves detection by up to 27 percentage points in scenarios where action-only monitoring fails to reliably identify sabotage. However, CoT traces can also contain misleading rationalizations that deceive the monitor, reducing performance in more obvious sabotage cases. To address this, we introduce a hybrid protocol that independently scores both reasoning and final outputs and combines them using a weighted average. This hybrid monitor consistently outperforms both CoT and action-only monitors across all tested models and tasks, with detection rates over four times higher than action-only monitoring for subtle deception scenarios.",

Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable these agents to interpret UI screens, identify actionable elements, and perform interactions such as tapping or typing. However, existing agents remain reactive: they reason only over the current screen and lack a structured model of app navigation flow, limiting their ability to understand context, detect unexpected outcomes, and recover from errors. We present MAPLE, a state-aware multi-agent framework that abstracts app interactions as a Finite State Machine (FSM). We computationally model each UI screen as a discrete state and user actions as transitions, allowing the FSM to provide a structured representation of the app execution. MAPLE consists of specialized agents responsible for four phases of task execution: planning, execution, verification, error recovery, and knowledge retention. These agents collaborate to dynamically construct FSMs in real time based on perception data extracted from the UI screen, allowing the GUI agents to track navigation progress and flow, validate action outcomes through pre- and post-conditions of the states, and recover from errors by rolling back to previously stable states. Our evaluation results on two challenging cross-app benchmarks, Mobile-Eval-E and SPA-Bench, show that MAPLE outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline, improving task success rate by up to 12%, recovery success by 13.8%, and action accuracy by 6.5%. Our results highlight the importance of structured state modeling in guiding mobile GUI agents during task execution.

In this paper, we propose Formula Tuning (Fortune), a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that trains LMs to generate executable spreadsheet formulas for question answering over general tabular data. Formula Tuning reduces the reliance on supervised formula annotations by using binary answer correctness as a reward signal, guiding the model to learn formula derivation through reasoning. We provide a theoretical analysis of its advantages and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on seven table reasoning benchmarks. Formula Tuning substantially enhances LM performance, particularly on multi-step numerical and symbolic reasoning tasks, enabling a 7B model to outperform O1 on table understanding.

To date, the research community has focused on designing separate algorithms for each stage. This separation has led to algorithms that generate teammate pools with limited coverage of possible behaviors, and that ignore whether the generated teammates are easy to learn from for the AHT agent. Furthermore, algorithms for training AHT agents typically treat the set of training teammates as static, thus attempting to generalize to previously unseen partner agents without assuming any control over the distribution of training teammates. In this paper, we present a unified framework for AHT by reformulating the problem as an open-ended learning process between an ad hoc agent and an adversarial teammate generator. We introduce ROTATE, a regret-driven, open-ended training algorithm that alternates between improving the AHT agent and generating teammates that probe its deficiencies.

However, RL approaches struggle to impart new capabilities not presented in the base model, highlighting the need to integrate more knowledge like FL into NL math reasoning effectively. Yet, this integration is challenging due to inherent disparities in problem structure and reasoning format between NL and FL. To address these challenges, we introduce **NL-FL HybridReasoning**, an end-to-end framework designed to incorporate the FL expert into NL math problem-solving. To bridge the NL and FL input format gap, we propose the *NL-FL Problem Alignment* method, which reformulates the Question-Answering (QA) problems in NL as existence theorems in FL. Subsequently, the *Mixed Problem Input* technique we provide enables the FL reasoner to handle both QA and existence problems concurrently. Lastly, we mitigate the NL and FL output format gap in reasoning through an LLM-based *Answer Extraction* mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the **HybridReasoning** framework achieves **89.80%** and **84.34%** accuracy rates on the MATH-500 and the AMC benchmarks, surpassing the NL baseline by 4.60% and 4.82%, respectively.

PSBench includes over one million structural models covering a wide range of protein sequence lengths, complex stoichiometries, functional classes, and modeling difficulties. Each model is annotated with multiple complementary quality scores at the global, local, and interface levels. PSBench also provides multiple evaluation metrics and baseline EMA methods to facilitate rigorous comparisons. To demonstrate PSBench's utility, we trained and evaluated GATE, a graph transformer-based EMA method, on the CASP15 data. GATE was blindly tested in CASP16 (2024), where it ranked among the top-performing EMA methods. These results highlight PSBench as a valuable resource for advancing EMA research in protein complex modeling. PSBench is publicly available at: https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PSBench.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22683v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Brain network analysis plays a crucial role in diagnosing and monitoring neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Existing approaches for constructing structural brain networks from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) often rely on specialized toolkits that suffer from inherent limitations: operator subjectivity, labor-intensive workflows, and restricted capacity to capture complex topological features and disease-specific biomarkers. To overcome these challenges and advance computational neuroimaging instrumentation, ConnectomeDiffuser is proposed as a novel diffusion-based framework for automated end-to-end brain network construction from DTI. The proposed model combines three key components: (1) a Template Network that extracts topological features from 3D DTI scans using Riemannian geometric principles, (2) a diffusion model that generates comprehensive brain networks with enhanced topological fidelity, and (3) a Graph Convolutional Network classifier that incorporates disease-specific markers to improve diagnostic accuracy. ConnectomeDiffuser demonstrates superior performance by capturing a broader range of structural connectivity and pathology-related information, enabling more sensitive analysis of individual variations in brain networks. Experimental validation on datasets representing two distinct neurodegenerative conditions demonstrates significant performance improvements over other brain network methods. This work contributes to the advancement of instrumentation in the context of neurological disorders, providing clinicians and researchers with a robust, generalizable measurement framework that facilitates more accurate diagnosis, deeper mechanistic understanding, and improved therapeutic monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD.",

We introduce DeepMultiConnectome, a deep-learning model that predicts structural connectomes directly from tractography, bypassing the need for gray matter parcellation while supporting multiple parcellation schemes. Using a point-cloud-based neural network with multi-task learning, the model classifies streamlines according to their connected regions across two parcellation schemes, sharing a learned representation. We train and validate DeepMultiConnectome on tractography from the Human Connectome Project Young Adult dataset ($n = 1000$), labeled with an 84 and 164 region gray matter parcellation scheme. DeepMultiConnectome predicts multiple structural connectomes from a whole-brain tractogram containing 3 million streamlines in approximately 40 seconds. DeepMultiConnectome is evaluated by comparing predicted connectomes with traditional connectomes generated using the conventional method of labeling streamlines using a gray matter parcellation. The predicted connectomes are highly correlated with traditionally generated connectomes ($r = 0.992$ for an 84-region scheme; $r = 0.986$ for a 164-region scheme) and largely preserve network properties. A test-retest analysis of DeepMultiConnectome demonstrates reproducibility comparable to traditionally generated connectomes. The predicted connectomes perform similarly to traditionally generated connectomes in predicting age and cognitive function. Overall, DeepMultiConnectome provides a scalable, fast model for generating subject-specific connectomes across multiple parcellation schemes.",

Understanding how such self-organizing dynamics emerge from first principles is crucial for advancing our understanding of neuronal computations and the design of artificial intelligence systems. Here we formalize how attractor networks emerge from the free energy principle applied to a universal partitioning of random dynamical systems. Our approach obviates the need for explicitly imposed learning and inference rules and identifies emergent, but efficient and biologically plausible inference and learning dynamics for such self-organizing systems. These result in a collective, multi-level Bayesian active inference process. Attractors on the free energy landscape encode prior beliefs; inference integrates sensory data into posterior beliefs; and learning fine-tunes couplings to minimize long-term surprise. Analytically and via simulations, we establish that the proposed networks favor approximately orthogonalized attractor representations, a consequence of simultaneously optimizing predictive accuracy and model complexity. These attractors efficiently span the input subspace, enhancing generalization and the mutual information between hidden causes and observable effects. Furthermore, while random data presentation leads to symmetric and sparse couplings, sequential data fosters asymmetric couplings and non-equilibrium steady-state dynamics, offering a natural extension to conventional Boltzmann Machines. Our findings offer a unifying theory of self-organizing attractor networks, providing novel insights for AI and neuroscience.",

Rather than predicting only the next token (NTP), MTP predicts the next $k$ tokens at each prediction step, using multiple prediction heads. MTP has shown promise in improving downstream performance, inference speed, and training efficiency, particularly for large models. However, prior work has shown that smaller language models (SLMs) struggle with the MTP objective. To address this, we propose a curriculum learning strategy for MTP training, exploring two variants: a forward curriculum, which gradually increases the complexity of the pre-training objective from NTP to MTP, and a reverse curriculum, which does the opposite. Our experiments show that the forward curriculum enables SLMs to better leverage the MTP objective during pre-training, improving downstream NTP performance and generative output quality, while retaining the benefits of self-speculative decoding. The reverse curriculum achieves stronger NTP performance and output quality, but fails to provide any self-speculative decoding benefits.",

While pre-trained foundation models show potential for addressing these challenges, they are typically designed for Regularly Sampled Time Series (RTS).

To mitigate the effect of missing values, VIMTS first processes IMTS along the timeline into feature patches at equal intervals. These patches are then complemented using learned cross-channel dependencies. Then it leverages visual MAE's capability in handling sparse multichannel data for patch reconstruction, followed by a coarse-to-fine technique to generate precise predictions from focused contexts.

Through two case studies, we investigate whether LLMs can meet these demands by generating reasoning over-text benchmarks and comparing them to those created through careful crowdsourcing. Specifically, we evaluate both the validity and difficulty of LLM-generated versions of two high-quality reading comprehension datasets: CondaQA, which evaluates reasoning about negation, and DROP, which targets reasoning about quantities. We find that prompting LLMs can produce variants of these datasets that are often valid according to the annotation guidelines, at a fraction of the cost of the original crowdsourcing effort.

    "title": "How Do Diffusion Models Improve Adversarial Robustness?",
    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22839v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent findings suggest that diffusion models significantly enhance empirical adversarial robustness. While some intuitive explanations have been proposed, the precise mechanisms underlying these improvements remain unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate how and how well diffusion models improve adversarial robustness. First, we observe that diffusion models intriguingly increase, rather than decrease, the $\\ell_p$ distance to clean samples--challenging the intuition that purification denoises inputs closer to the original data. Second, we find that the purified images are heavily influenced by the internal randomness of diffusion models, where a compression effect arises within each randomness configuration. Motivated by this observation, we evaluate robustness under fixed randomness and find that the improvement drops to approximately 24% on CIFAR-10--substantially lower than prior reports approaching 70%. Importantly, we show that this remaining robustness gain strongly correlates with the model's ability to compress the input space, revealing the compression rate as a reliable robustness indicator without requiring gradient-based analysis. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying diffusion-based purification, and offer guidance for developing more effective and principled adversarial purification systems.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22843v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The performance figures of modern drift-adaptive malware classifiers appear promising, but does this translate to genuine operational reliability? The standard evaluation paradigm primarily focuses on baseline performance metrics, neglecting confidence-error alignment and operational stability. While TESSERACT established the importance of temporal evaluation, we take a complementary direction by investigating whether malware classifiers maintain reliable confidence estimates under distribution shifts and exploring the tensions between scientific advancement and practical impacts when they do not. We propose AURORA, a framework to evaluate malware classifiers based on their confidence quality and operational resilience. AURORA subjects the confidence profile of a given model to verification to assess the reliability of its estimates. Unreliable confidence estimates erode operational trust, waste valuable annotation budget on non-informative samples for active learning, and leave error-prone instances undetected in selective classification. AURORA is further complemented by a set of metrics designed to go beyond point-in-time performance, striving towards a more holistic assessment of operational stability throughout temporal evaluation periods. The fragility we observe in state-of-the-art frameworks across datasets of varying drift severity suggests the need for a return to the whiteboard.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22845v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Generative artificial intelligence is developing rapidly, impacting humans' interaction with information and digital media. It is increasingly used to create deceptively realistic misinformation, so lawmakers have imposed regulations requiring the disclosure of AI-generated content. However, only little is known about whether these labels reduce the risks of AI-generated misinformation.\n  Our work addresses this research gap. Focusing on AI-generated images, we study the implications of labels, including the possibility of mislabeling. Assuming that simplicity, transparency, and trust are likely to impact the successful adoption of such labels, we first qualitatively explore users' opinions and expectations of AI labeling using five focus groups. Second, we conduct a pre-registered online survey with over 1300 U.S. and EU participants to quantitatively assess the effect of AI labels on users' ability to recognize misinformation containing either human-made or AI-generated images. Our focus groups illustrate that, while participants have concerns about the practical implementation of labeling, they consider it helpful in identifying AI-generated images and avoiding deception. However, considering security benefits, our survey revealed an ambiguous picture, suggesting that users might over-rely on labels. While inaccurate claims supported by labeled AI-generated images were rated less credible than those with unlabeled AI-images, the belief in accurate claims also decreased when accompanied by a labeled AI-generated image. Moreover, we find the undesired side effect that human-made images conveying inaccurate claims were perceived as more credible in the presence of labels.",

These access control structures can completely break down if an LLM fine-tuned on the siloed data serves requests, for downstream tasks, from individuals with disparate access privileges. We propose Permissioned LLMs (PermLLM), a new class of LLMs that superimpose the organizational data access control structures on query responses they generate. We formalize abstractions underpinning the means to determine whether access control enforcement happens correctly over LLM query responses. Our formalism introduces the notion of a relevant response that can be used to prove whether a PermLLM mechanism has been implemented correctly. We also introduce a novel metric, called access advantage, to empirically evaluate the efficacy of a PermLLM mechanism. We introduce three novel PermLLM mechanisms that build on Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning to achieve the desired access control. We furthermore present two instantiations of access advantage--(i) Domain Distinguishability Index (DDI) based on Membership Inference Attacks, and (ii) Utility Gap Index (UGI) based on LLM utility evaluation.

Although many methods have been proposed to solve this problem, they struggle with rendering quality and streamable inference. Synthesizing high-quality binaural audio that is indistinguishable from real-world recordings requires precise modeling of binaural cues, room reverb, and ambient sounds. Additionally, real-world applications demand streaming inference. To address these challenges, we propose a flow matching based streaming binaural speech synthesis framework called BinauralFlow. We consider binaural rendering to be a generation problem rather than a regression problem and design a conditional flow matching model to render high-quality audio. Moreover, we design a causal U-Net architecture that estimates the current audio frame solely based on past information to tailor generative models for streaming inference. Finally, we introduce a continuous inference pipeline incorporating streaming STFT/ISTFT operations, a buffer bank, a midpoint solver, and an early skip schedule to improve rendering continuity and speed. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches.

Existing approaches often struggle to balance collecting high-quality observations from multiple view angles and avoiding unnecessary repetitive traversal. To fill this gap, we propose a complete system combining mapping and planning. We first redefine the task as completing both geometric coverage and semantic viewpoint observation. We then manage semantic and geometric viewpoints separately and propose a novel Priority-driven Decoupled Local Sampler to generate local viewpoint sets. This enables explicit multi-view semantic inspection and voxel coverage without unnecessary repetition. Building on this, we develop a hierarchical planner to ensure efficient global coverage. In addition, we propose a Safe Aggressive Exploration State Machine, which allows aggressive exploration behavior while ensuring the robot's safety. Our system includes a plug-and-play semantic target mapping module that integrates seamlessly with state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms for pointcloud-level dense semantic target mapping. We validate our approach through extensive experiments in both realistic simulations and complex real-world environments. Simulation results show that our planner achieves faster exploration and shorter travel distances while guaranteeing a specified number of multi-view inspections.

Numerous approaches have been explored to address these issues, such as LoRA. While these methods are effective for fine-tuning, their application to pre-training is significantly more challenging due to the need to learn vast datasets. Motivated by this issue, we aim to address the following questions: Can parameter- or memory-efficient methods enhance pre-training efficiency while achieving performance comparable to full-model training? How can the performance gap be narrowed? To this end, the contributions of this work are the following. (1) We begin by conducting a comprehensive survey that summarizes state-of-the-art methods for efficient pre-training. (2) We perform a benchmark evaluation of several representative memory efficient pre-training approaches to comprehensively evaluate their performance across model sizes. We observe that with a proper choice of optimizer and hyperparameters, full-rank training delivers the best performance, as expected. We also notice that incorporating high-rank updates in low-rank approaches is the key to improving their performance. (3) Finally, we propose two practical techniques, namely weight refactorization and momentum reset, to enhance the performance of efficient pre-training methods. We observe that applying these techniques to the low-rank method (on a 1B model) can achieve a lower perplexity than popular memory efficient algorithms such as GaLore and Fira, while simultaneously using about 25% less memory.",

    "title": "OWL: Probing Cross-Lingual Recall of Memorized Texts via World Literature",
    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22945v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to memorize and recall English text from their pretraining data. However, the extent to which this ability generalizes to non-English languages or transfers across languages remains unclear. This paper investigates multilingual and cross-lingual memorization in LLMs, probing if memorized content in one language (e.g., English) can be recalled when presented in translation. To do so, we introduce OWL, a dataset of 31.5K aligned excerpts from 20 books in ten languages, including English originals, official translations (Vietnamese, Spanish, Turkish), and new translations in six low-resource languages (Sesotho, Yoruba, Maithili, Malagasy, Setswana, Tahitian). We evaluate memorization across model families and sizes through three tasks: (1) direct probing, which asks the model to identify a book's title and author; (2) name cloze, which requires predicting masked character names; and (3) prefix probing, which involves generating continuations. We find that LLMs consistently recall content across languages, even for texts without direct translation in pretraining data. GPT-4o, for example, identifies authors and titles 69% of the time and masked entities 6% of the time in newly translated excerpts. Perturbations (e.g., masking characters, shuffling words) modestly reduce direct probing accuracy (7% drop for shuffled official translations). Our results highlight the extent of cross-lingual memorization and provide insights on the differences between the models.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22946v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Negation is a fundamental linguistic phenomenon that can entirely reverse the meaning of a sentence. As vision language models (VLMs) continue to advance and are deployed in high-stakes applications, assessing their ability to comprehend negation becomes essential. To address this, we introduce NegVQA, a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark consisting of 7,379 two-choice questions covering diverse negation scenarios and image-question distributions. We construct NegVQA by leveraging large language models to generate negated versions of questions from existing VQA datasets. Evaluating 20 state-of-the-art VLMs across seven model families, we find that these models struggle significantly with negation, exhibiting a substantial performance drop compared to their responses to the original questions. Furthermore, we uncover a U-shaped scaling trend, where increasing model size initially degrades performance on NegVQA before leading to improvements. Our benchmark reveals critical gaps in VLMs' negation understanding and offers insights into future VLM development. Project page available at https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/NegVQA/.",

Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22973v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Diffusion models represent the state-of-the-art for solving inverse problems such as image restoration tasks. In the Bayesian framework, diffusion-based inverse solvers incorporate a likelihood term to guide the prior sampling process, generating data consistent with the posterior distribution. However, due to the intractability of the likelihood term, many current methods rely on isotropic Gaussian approximations, which lead to deviations from the data manifold and result in inconsistent, unstable reconstructions. We propose Equivariance Regularized (EquiReg) diffusion, a general framework for regularizing posterior sampling in diffusion-based inverse problem solvers. EquiReg enhances reconstructions by reweighting diffusion trajectories and penalizing those that deviate from the data manifold. We define a new distribution-dependent equivariance error, empirically identify functions that exhibit low error for on-manifold samples and higher error for off-manifold samples, and leverage these functions to regularize the diffusion sampling process. When applied to a variety of solvers, EquiReg outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models in both linear and nonlinear image restoration tasks, as well as in reconstructing partial differential equations.",

Such a model enables high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations. However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore, most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling 150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft, collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths, allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model baselines are evaluated on our benchmark.

To do this tractably, almost all LLM PTQ algorithms quantize linear layers by independently minimizing the immediate activation error. However, this localized objective ignores the effect of subsequent layers, so reducing it does not necessarily give a closer model. In this work, we introduce Yet Another Quantization Algorithm (YAQA), an adaptive rounding algorithm that uses Kronecker-factored approximations of each linear layer's Hessian with respect to the \\textit{full model} KL divergence. YAQA consists of two components: Kronecker-factored sketches of the full layerwise Hessian that can be tractably computed for hundred-billion parameter LLMs, and a quantizer-independent rounding algorithm that uses these sketches and comes with theoretical guarantees. Across a wide range of models and quantizers, YAQA empirically reduces the KL divergence to the original model by $\\approx 30\\%$ while achieving state of the art performance on downstream tasks.",

This task becomes an emerging research issue in the era of large language models (LLMs) since real-world claims are often complex, featuring intricate semantic structures or obfuscated entities. Traditional approaches typically address this by decomposing claims into sub-claims and querying a knowledge base to resolve hidden or ambiguous entities. However, the absence of effective disambiguation strategies for these entities can compromise the entire verification process. To address these challenges, we propose Verify-in-the-Graph (VeGraph), a novel framework leveraging the reasoning and comprehension abilities of LLM agents. VeGraph operates in three phases: (1) Graph Representation - an input claim is decomposed into structured triplets, forming a graph-based representation that integrates both structured and unstructured information; (2) Entity Disambiguation -VeGraph iteratively interacts with the knowledge base to resolve ambiguous entities within the graph for deeper sub-claim verification; and (3) Verification - remaining triplets are verified to complete the fact-checking process. Experiments using Meta-Llama-3-70B (instruct version) show that VeGraph achieves competitive performance compared to baselines on two benchmarks HoVer and FEVEROUS, effectively addressing claim verification challenges.

The robust RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training, but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO, the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample efficiency in offline robust RL.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce $K^2$VAE, an efficient VAE-based generative model that leverages a KoopmanNet to transform nonlinear time series into a linear dynamical system, and devises a KalmanNet to refine predictions and model uncertainty in such linear system, which reduces error accumulation in long-term forecasting.

The framework further ensures model utility by proportionally synthesizing benign instructions through non-malicious interpretations of behavior chains, precisely calibrating the boundary between helpfulness and harmlessness.

To address this issue, we develop CHED -- a benchmark designed to evaluate the context robustness of KE methods. Evaluations on CHED show that they often fail when preceding contexts are present. To mitigate this shortcoming, we introduce CoRE, a KE method designed to strengthen context robustness by minimizing context-sensitive variance in hidden states of the model for edited knowledge. This method not only improves the editing success rate in situations where a preceding context is present but also preserves the overall capabilities of the model.

This strategy relies on assumptions about the number and nature of subpopulations and annotations on group membership, which are unavailable for many real-world datasets. Instead, we propose using an ensemble of diverse classifiers to adaptively capture risk associated with subpopulations.

However, this hypothesis remains underexplored in prior works on unified VLMs. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalization across understanding and generation tasks in unified VLMs. Specifically, we design a dataset closely aligned with real-world scenarios to facilitate extensive experiments and quantitative evaluations. We evaluate multiple unified VLM architectures to validate our findings. Our key findings are as follows. First, unified VLMs trained with mixed data exhibit mutual benefits in understanding and generation tasks across various architectures, and this mutual benefits can scale up with increased data. Second, better alignment between multimodal input and output spaces will lead to better generalization. Third, the knowledge acquired during generation tasks can transfer to understanding tasks, and this cross-task generalization occurs within the base language model, beyond modality adapters.

Specifically, semantically equivalent primitives are retrieved for each primitive in the training samples, and the retrieved features are aggregated with the original primitive to refine the model. This process helps the model learn consistent representations for the same semantic primitives across different modalities. To evaluate the MSCG ability of VQA models, we construct a new GQA-MSCG dataset based on the GQA dataset, in which samples include three types of novel compositions composed of primitives from different modalities.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23059v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs), including applications in information retrieval (IR). However, it often leads to overthinking, where models produce excessively long and semantically redundant traces with little or no benefit. We identify two key challenges in IR: redundant trajectories that revisit similar states and misguided reasoning that diverges from user intent. To address these, we propose State Machine Reasoning (SMR), a transition-based reasoning framework composed of discrete actions (Refine, Rerank, Stop) that support early stopping and fine-grained control. Experiments on the BEIR and BRIGHT benchmarks show that SMR improves retrieval performance (nDCG@10) by 3.4% while reducing token usage by 74.4%. It generalizes across LLMs and retrievers without requiring task-specific tuning, offering a practical alternative to conventional CoT reasoning.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23062v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Incorporating pre-collected offline data from a source environment can significantly improve the sample efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL), but this benefit is often challenged by discrepancies between the transition dynamics of the source and target environments. Existing methods typically address this issue by penalizing or filtering out source transitions in high dynamics-gap regions. However, their estimation of the dynamics gap often relies on KL divergence or mutual information, which can be ill-defined when the source and target dynamics have disjoint support. To overcome these limitations, we propose CompFlow, a method grounded in the theoretical connection between flow matching and optimal transport. Specifically, we model the target dynamics as a conditional flow built upon the output distribution of the source-domain flow, rather than learning it directly from a Gaussian prior. This composite structure offers two key advantages: (1) improved generalization for learning target dynamics, and (2) a principled estimation of the dynamics gap via the Wasserstein distance between source and target transitions. Leveraging our principled estimation of the dynamics gap, we further introduce an optimistic active data collection strategy that prioritizes exploration in regions of high dynamics gap, and theoretically prove that it reduces the performance disparity with the optimal policy. Empirically, CompFlow outperforms strong baselines across several RL benchmarks with shifted dynamics.",

To address this issue, we propose an innovative algorithm called Granular-Ball based Quantum $k$NN(GB-Q$k$NN).

The search process is then accelerated by adopting a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) method. Moreover, we optimize the time-consuming steps, such as distance calculation, of the HNSW via quantization, further reducing the time complexity of the construct and search process.

In this paper, we investigate the adaption of Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding for document-level text generation tasks. MBR decoding makes use of a utility function to estimate the output with the highest expected utility from a set of candidate outputs. Although MBR decoding is shown to be effective in a wide range of sentence-level text generation tasks, its performance on document-level text generation tasks is limited as many of the utility functions are designed for evaluating the utility of sentences. To this end, we propose MBR-OT, a variant of MBR decoding using Wasserstein distance to compute the utility of a document using a sentence-level utility function. The experimental result shows that the performance of MBR-OT outperforms that of the standard MBR in document-level machine translation, text simplification, and dense image captioning tasks.

Existing methods, primarily optimized for single images, often suffer from temporal inconsistencies and fail to capture fine-grained dynamic details. To address these limitations, we present GeoMan, a novel architecture designed to produce accurate and temporally consistent depth and normal estimations from monocular human videos. GeoMan addresses two key challenges: the scarcity of high-quality 4D training data and the need for metric depth estimation to accurately model human size. To overcome the first challenge, GeoMan employs an image-based model to estimate depth and normals for the first frame of a video, which then conditions a video diffusion model, reframing video geometry estimation task as an image-to-video generation problem. This design offloads the heavy lifting of geometric estimation to the image model and simplifies the video model's role to focus on intricate details while using priors learned from large-scale video datasets. Consequently, GeoMan improves temporal consistency and generalizability while requiring minimal 4D training data. To address the challenge of accurate human size estimation, we introduce a root-relative depth representation that retains critical human-scale details and is easier to be estimated from monocular inputs, overcoming the limitations of traditional affine-invariant and metric depth representations. GeoMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness in overcoming longstanding challenges in 3D human geometry estimation from videos.",

This poses challenges for the development of a unified pipeline to learn embeddings for various EEG signal classification, which is often involved in various decoding tasks. Traditionally, EEG classification involves the step of signal preprocessing and the use of deep learning techniques, which are highly dependent on the number of EEG channels in each sample. However, the same pipeline cannot be applied even if the EEG data is collected for the same experiment but with different acquisition devices. This necessitates the development of a framework for learning EEG embeddings, which could be highly beneficial for tasks involving multiple EEG samples for the same task but with varying numbers of EEG channels. In this work, we propose EEG Adapter (EAD), a flexible framework compatible with any signal acquisition device. More specifically, we leverage a recent EEG foundational model with significant adaptations to learn robust representations from the EEG data for the classification task. We evaluate EAD on two publicly available datasets achieving state-of-the-art accuracies 99.33% and 92.31% on EEG-ImageNet and BrainLat respectively.

Furthermore, CrossLinear employs patch-wise processing and a global linear head to effectively capture both short-term and long-term temporal dependencies, further improving its forecasting precision. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that CrossLinear achieves superior performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks.

Existing merging methods often assume that entries at identical positions in weight matrices serve the same function, enabling straightforward entry-wise comparison and merging. However, this assumption overlooks the complexity of finetuned neural networks, where neurons may develop distinct feature compositions, making direct entry-wise merging problematic. We present Decom-Renorm-Merge (DRM), a simple yet effective approach that leverages Singular Value Decomposition to decompose and coordinate weight matrices into an aligned joint space, where entry-wise merging becomes possible. We showcase the effectiveness of DRM across various settings ranging from smaller encoder-based such as ViT and DeBERTa, encoder-decoder-based such as T5, and larger decoder-based such as Llama3.1-8B. Our experimental results show that DRM outperforms several state-of-the-art merging techniques across full finetuning and low-rank adaptation settings.

Existing text-guided methods often lead to ambiguities regarding user intentions and restrict fine-grained control over editing specific aspects of objects. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach named {Zero-to-Hero}, which focuses on reference-based video editing that disentangles the editing process into two distinct problems. It achieves this by first editing an anchor frame to satisfy user requirements as a reference image and then consistently propagating its appearance across other frames. We leverage correspondence within the original frames to guide the attention mechanism, which is more robust than previously proposed optical flow or temporal modules in memory-friendly video generative models, especially when dealing with objects exhibiting large motions. It offers a solid ZERO-shot initialization that ensures both accuracy and temporal consistency. However, intervention in the attention mechanism results in compounded imaging degradation with over-saturated colors and unknown blurring issues.

However, the design of an optimal augmentation strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize the three properties, we propose the lightweight yet effective Frequency Refined Augmentation (FreRA) tailored for time series contrastive learning on classification tasks, which can be seamlessly integrated with contrastive learning frameworks in a plug-and-play manner. Specifically, FreRA automatically separates critical and unimportant frequency components. Accordingly, we propose semantic-aware Identity Modification and semantic-agnostic Self-adaptive Modification to protect semantically relevant information in the critical frequency components and infuse variance into the unimportant ones respectively. Theoretically, we prove that FreRA generates semantic-preserving views. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, including UCR and UEA archives, as well as five large-scale datasets on diverse applications.

During inference, agents retrieve high-reward, task-relevant experiences as few-shot examples to enhance the effectiveness of each reasoning step, thereby enabling more accurate and efficient multi-agent collaboration. Experimental results on diverse datasets demonstrate that MAEL empowers agents to learn from prior task experiences effectively-achieving faster convergence and producing higher-quality solutions on current tasks.",

However, previous methods rely on substantial human labor or time to gather such experiences for each task, which is impractical given the growing variety of task types in user queries to LLMs. To address this issue, we design an autonomous experience transfer framework to explore whether LLMs can mimic human cognitive intelligence to autonomously transfer experience from existing source tasks to newly encountered target tasks. This not only allows the acquisition of experience without extensive costs of previous methods, but also offers a novel path for the generalization of LLMs. Experimental results on 13 datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves the performance of LLMs. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of each module in the framework.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23195v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Scaling laws motivate the development of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) that pre-train vast parameters and achieve remarkable zero-shot forecasting performance. Surprisingly, even after fine-tuning, TSFMs cannot consistently outperform smaller, specialized models trained on full-shot downstream data. A key question is how to realize effective adaptation of TSFMs for a target forecasting task. Through empirical studies on various TSFMs, the pre-trained models often exhibit inherent sparsity and redundancy in computation, suggesting that TSFMs have learned to activate task-relevant network substructures to accommodate diverse forecasting tasks. To preserve this valuable prior knowledge, we propose a structured pruning method to regularize the subsequent fine-tuning process by focusing it on a more relevant and compact parameter space. Extensive experiments on seven TSFMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning a smaller, pruned TSFM significantly improves forecasting performance compared to fine-tuning original models. This \"prune-then-finetune\" paradigm often enables TSFMs to achieve state-of-the-art performance and surpass strong specialized baselines.",

ISTD is challenged by targets occupying less than 0.15% of the image and low distinguishability from complex backgrounds. Existing deep learning methods often suffer from information loss during downsampling and inefficient global context modeling. This paper presents SAMamba, a novel framework integrating SAM2's hierarchical feature learning with Mamba's selective sequence modeling. Key innovations include: (1) A Feature Selection Adapter (FS-Adapter) for efficient natural-to-infrared domain adaptation via dual-stage selection (token-level with a learnable task embedding and channel-wise adaptive transformations); (2) A Cross-Channel State-Space Interaction (CSI) module for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity using selective state space modeling; and (3) A Detail-Preserving Contextual Fusion (DPCF) module that adaptively combines multi-scale features with a gating mechanism to balance high-resolution and low-resolution feature contributions. SAMamba addresses core ISTD challenges by bridging the domain gap, maintaining fine-grained details, and efficiently modeling long-range dependencies. Experiments on NUAA-SIRST, IRSTD-1k, and NUDT-SIRST datasets show SAMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in challenging scenarios with heterogeneous backgrounds and varying target scales.

However, applying these methods to open-ended dialogues, such as those in psychological counseling, presents unique challenges. Unlike tasks with objective correctness, success in therapeutic conversations depends on subjective factors like empathetic engagement, ethical adherence, and alignment with human preferences, for which strict \"correctness\" criteria are ill-defined. Existing result-oriented MCTS approaches can therefore produce misaligned responses. To address this, we introduce MCTSr-Zero, an MCTS framework designed for open-ended, human-centric dialogues. Its core innovation is \"domain alignment\", which shifts the MCTS search objective from predefined end-states towards conversational trajectories that conform to target domain principles (e.g., empathy in counseling). Furthermore, MCTSr-Zero incorporates \"Regeneration\" and \"Meta-Prompt Adaptation\" mechanisms to substantially broaden exploration by allowing the MCTS to consider fundamentally different initial dialogue strategies. We evaluate MCTSr-Zero in psychological counseling by generating multi-turn dialogue data, which is used to fine-tune an LLM, PsyLLM. We also introduce PsyEval, a benchmark for assessing multi-turn psychological counseling dialogues. Experiments demonstrate that PsyLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on PsyEval and other relevant metrics, validating MCTSr-Zero's effectiveness in generating high-quality, principle-aligned conversational data for human-centric domains and addressing the LLM challenge of consistently adhering to complex psychological standards.",

As an effective RLHF approach, group relative policy optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated success in many LLM-based applications. However, efficient GRPO-based RLHF training remains a challenge. Recent studies reveal that a higher reward variance of the initial policy model leads to faster RLHF training. Inspired by this finding, we propose a practical reward adjustment model to accelerate RLHF training by provably increasing the reward variance and preserving the relative preferences and reward expectation. Our reward adjustment method inherently poses a nonconvex optimization problem, which is NP-hard to solve in general. To overcome the computational challenges, we design a novel $O(n \\log n)$ algorithm to find a global solution of the nonconvex reward adjustment model by explicitly characterizing the extreme points of the feasible set. As an important application, we naturally integrate this reward adjustment model into the GRPO algorithm, leading to a more efficient GRPO with reward variance increase (GRPOVI) algorithm for RLHF training. As an interesting byproduct, we provide an indirect explanation for the empirical effectiveness of GRPO with rule-based reward for RLHF training, as demonstrated in DeepSeek-R1. Experiment results demonstrate that the GRPOVI algorithm can significantly improve the RLHF training efficiency compared to the original GRPO algorithm.",

While foundational models like Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have enhanced service-oriented navigation systems through improved perception and decision-making, their integration introduces vulnerabilities in mission-critical service workflows. Existing adversarial attacks fail to address service computing contexts, where reliability and quality-of-service (QoS) are paramount. We utilize AdvOF to investigate and explore the impact of adversarial environments on the VLM-based perception module of VLN agents. In particular, AdvOF first precisely aggregates and aligns the victim object positions in both 2D and 3D space, defining and rendering adversarial objects. Then, we collaboratively optimize the adversarial object with regularization between the adversarial and victim object across physical properties and VLM perceptions. Through assigning importance weights to varying views, the optimization is processed stably and multi-viewedly by iterative fusions from local updates and justifications. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate AdvOF can effectively degrade agent performance under adversarial conditions while maintaining minimal interference with normal navigation tasks.

However, such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content sourced from the public internet, raising concerns about data privacy and ownership. Regulatory frameworks, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), grant individuals the right to request the removal of such sensitive information. This has motivated the development of machine unlearning algorithms that aim to remove specific knowledge from models without the need for costly retraining. Despite these advancements, evaluating the efficacy of unlearning algorithms remains a challenge due to the inherent complexity and generative nature of LLMs. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive auditing framework for unlearning evaluation, comprising three benchmark datasets, six unlearning algorithms, and five prompt-based auditing methods. By using various auditing algorithms, we evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of different unlearning strategies.

This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of Arabic machine-generated text, examining multiple generation strategies (generation from the title only, content-aware generation, and text refinement) across diverse model architectures (ALLaM, Jais, Llama, and GPT-4) in academic, and social media domains. Our stylometric analysis reveals distinctive linguistic patterns differentiating human-written from machine-generated Arabic text across these varied contexts. Despite their human-like qualities, we demonstrate that LLMs produce detectable signatures in their Arabic outputs, with domain-specific characteristics that vary significantly between different contexts. Based on these insights, we developed BERT-based detection models that achieved exceptional performance in formal contexts (up to 99.9\\% F1-score) with strong precision across model architectures. Our cross-domain analysis confirms generalization challenges previously reported in the literature.

Using this framework, we conduct controlled experiments and find that longer responses exhibit lower factual precision, confirming the presence of length bias.

However, the potential vulnerability and anti-interference ability have still not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the first adversarial attack and defense framework for pedestrian attribute recognition. Specifically, we exploit both global- and patch-level attacks on the pedestrian images, based on the pre-trained CLIP-based PAR framework. It first divides the input pedestrian image into non-overlapping patches and embeds them into feature embeddings using a projection layer. Meanwhile, the attribute set is expanded into sentences using prompts and embedded into attribute features using a pre-trained CLIP text encoder. A multi-modal Transformer is adopted to fuse the obtained vision and text tokens, and a feed-forward network is utilized for attribute recognition. Based on the aforementioned PAR framework, we adopt the adversarial semantic and label-perturbation to generate the adversarial noise, termed ASL-PAR. We also design a semantic offset defense strategy to suppress the influence of adversarial attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on both digital domains (i.e., PETA, PA100K, MSP60K, RAPv2) and physical domains fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed adversarial attack and defense strategies for the pedestrian attribute recognition.

Confidence modelling addresses this by assigning a reliability estimate measure, in the form of a confidence score, to each automated score. In this study, we frame confidence estimation as a classification task: predicting whether an AES-generated score correctly places a candidate in the appropriate CEFR level. While this is a binary decision, we leverage the inherent granularity of the scoring domain in two ways. First, we reformulate the task as an n-ary classification problem using score binning. Second, we introduce a set of novel Kernel Weighted Ordinal Categorical Cross Entropy (KWOCCE) loss functions that incorporate the ordinal structure of CEFR labels. Our best-performing model achieves an F1 score of 0.97, and enables the system to release 47% of scores with 100% CEFR agreement and 99% with at least 95% CEFR agreement -compared to approximately 92% (approx.) CEFR agreement from the standalone AES model where we release all AM predicted scores.",

In this paper, we investigate the application of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune next-scale visual autoregressive (VAR) models. Our empirical results demonstrate that this approach enables alignment to intricate reward signals derived from aesthetic predictors and CLIP embeddings, significantly enhancing image quality and enabling precise control over the generation style. Interestingly, by leveraging CLIP, our method can help VAR models generalize beyond their initial ImageNet distribution: through RL-driven exploration, these models can generate images aligned with prompts referencing image styles that were absent during pre-training. In summary, we show that RL-based fine-tuning is both efficient and effective for VAR models, benefiting particularly from their fast inference speeds, which are advantageous for online sampling, an aspect that poses significant challenges for diffusion-based alternatives.",

However, if these rewards are inherently imperfect, exhibiting various biases, they can adversely affect the alignment of large language models (LLMs). In this paper, we collectively define the various biases present in rewards as the problem of reward unfairness. We propose a bias-agnostic method to address the issue of reward fairness from a resource allocation perspective, without specifically designing for each type of bias, yet effectively mitigating them. Specifically, we model preference learning as a resource allocation problem, treating rewards as resources to be allocated while considering the trade-off between utility and fairness in their distribution. We propose two methods, Fairness Regularization and Fairness Coefficient, to achieve fairness in rewards. We apply our methods in both verification and reinforcement learning scenarios to obtain a fairness reward model and a policy model, respectively. Experiments conducted in these scenarios demonstrate that our approach aligns LLMs with human preferences in a more fair manner.",

In this paper, we present a causal framework to analyze how agent outputs, whether correct or erroneous, propagate under topologies with varying sparsity. Our empirical studies reveal that moderately sparse topologies, which effectively suppress error propagation while preserving beneficial information diffusion, typically achieve optimal task performance.

In particular, susceptibility maps provide adequate contrast to distinguish between \"rim\" lesions, surrounded by deposited paramagnetic iron, and \"non-rim\" lesion types. These paramagnetic rim lesions (PRLs) are an emerging biomarker in multiple sclerosis. Much effort has been devoted to both detection and segmentation of such lesions to monitor longitudinal change. As paramagnetic rim lesions are rare, addressing this problem requires confronting the class imbalance between rim and non-rim lesions. We produce synthetic quantitative susceptibility maps of paramagnetic rim lesions and show that inclusion of such synthetic data improves classifier performance and provide a multi-channel extension to generate accompanying contrasts and probabilistic segmentation maps. We exploit the projection capability of our trained generative network to demonstrate a novel denoising approach that allows us to train on ambiguous rim cases and substantially increase the minority class.

Therefore, a concise, informative representation of a local protein environment is essential for modeling and designing proteins and biomolecular interactions. However, these environments' extensive structural and chemical variability makes them challenging to model, and such representations remain under-explored. In this work, we propose a novel representation for a local protein environment derived from the intermediate features of atomistic foundation models (AFMs). We demonstrate that this embedding effectively captures both local structure (e.g., secondary motifs), and chemical features (e.g., amino-acid identity and protonation state). We further show that the AFM-derived representation space exhibits meaningful structure, enabling the construction of data-driven priors over the distribution of biomolecular environments. Finally, in the context of biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the proposed representations enable a first-of-its-kind physics-informed chemical shift predictor that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Our results demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of atomistic foundation models and their emergent representations for protein modeling beyond traditional molecular simulations.

However, cross-modality misalignment -- caused by sensor placement, acquisition timing, and resolution disparity -- induces a fundamental challenge. Conventional deep learning methods assume perfect pixel-wise alignment and rely on per-pixel reconstruction losses, leading to spectral distortion, double edges, and blurring when misalignment is present. To address this, we propose PAN-Crafter, a modality-consistent alignment framework that explicitly mitigates the misalignment gap between PAN and MS modalities. At its core, Modality-Adaptive Reconstruction (MARs) enables a single network to jointly reconstruct HRMS and PAN images, leveraging PAN's high-frequency details as auxiliary self-supervision. Additionally, we introduce Cross-Modality Alignment-Aware Attention (CM3A), a novel mechanism that bidirectionally aligns MS texture to PAN structure and vice versa, enabling adaptive feature refinement across modalities. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our PAN-Crafter outperforms the most recent state-of-the-art method in all metrics, even with 50.11$\\times$ faster inference time and 0.63$\\times$ the memory size.

However, NSFW images are now presented in increasingly sophisticated ways, often using image details and complex semantics to obscure their true nature or attract more views. Although still understandable to humans, these images often evade existing detection methods, posing a significant threat. Further complicating the issue, varying regulations across platforms and regions create additional challenges for effective moderation, leading to detection bias and reduced accuracy. To address this, we propose VModA, a general and effective framework that adapts to diverse moderation rules and handles complex, semantically rich NSFW content across categories. Experimental results show that VModA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 54.3% accuracy improvement across NSFW types, including those with complex semantics. Further experiments demonstrate that our method exhibits strong adaptability across categories, scenarios, and base VLMs. We also identified inconsistent and controversial label samples in public NSFW benchmark datasets, re-annotated them, and submitted corrections to the original maintainers. Two datasets have confirmed the updates so far. Additionally, we evaluate VModA in real-world scenarios to demonstrate its practical effectiveness.",

Recent works address both issues by (i)~training multi-head models using the task-incremental learning framework, and (ii) predicting the task identity employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors. While effective, the latter mainly relies on joint training with a memory buffer of past data, raising concerns around privacy, scalability, and increased training time. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of post-hoc OOD detection methods and investigate their potential to eliminate the need for a memory buffer. We uncover that these methods, when applied appropriately at inference time, can serve as a strong substitute for buffer-based OOD detection. We show that this buffer-free approach achieves comparable or superior performance to buffer-based methods both in terms of class-incremental learning and the rejection of unknown samples.

Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks.

While existing open-source SE agents mostly rely on ReAct (Yao et al., 2023b), Reflexion (Shinn et al., 2023), or Code-Act (Wang et al., 2024), all of these reasoning and planning frameworks inefficiently discard their long-term memory after a single task instance. As repository-level understanding is pivotal for identifying all locations requiring a patch for fixing a bug, we hypothesize that SE is particularly well positioned to benefit from CTIM. For this, we build on the Experiential Learning (EL) approach ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024), proposing a Mixture-Of-Experts (MoEs) inspired approach to create both a general-purpose and repository-level CTIM. We find that CTIM-Rover does not outperform AutoCodeRover in any configuration and thus conclude that neither ExpeL nor DoT-Bank (Lingam et al., 2024) scale to real-world SE problems.

Diffusion Actor-Critic with Entropy Regulator (DACER) extended this capability to online RL by using the reverse diffusion process as a policy approximator, trained end-to-end with policy gradient methods, achieving strong performance. However, this comes at the cost of requiring many diffusion steps, which significantly hampers training efficiency, while directly reducing the steps leads to noticeable performance degradation. Critically, the lack of inference efficiency becomes a significant bottleneck for applying diffusion policies in real-time online RL settings. To improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining or even enhancing performance, we propose a Q-gradient field objective as an auxiliary optimization target to guide the denoising process at each diffusion step. Nonetheless, we observe that the independence of the Q-gradient field from the diffusion time step negatively impacts the performance of the diffusion policy. To address this, we introduce a temporal weighting mechanism that enables the model to efficiently eliminate large-scale noise in the early stages and refine actions in the later stages. Experimental results on MuJoCo benchmarks and several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the DACER2 algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in most MuJoCo control tasks with only five diffusion steps, while also exhibiting stronger multimodality compared to DACER.",

As the use of LLMs continues to grow, many efforts have focused on reducing the massive training overheads of these models. But it is the environmental impact of handling user requests to LLMs that is increasingly becoming a concern. Recent studies estimate that the costs of operating LLMs in their inference phase can exceed training costs by 25x per year. As LLMs are queried incessantly, the cumulative carbon footprint for the operational phase has been shown to far exceed the footprint during the training phase. Further, estimates indicate that 500 ml of fresh water is expended for every 20-50 requests to LLMs during inference. To address these important sustainability issues with LLMs, we propose a novel framework called SLIT to co-optimize LLM quality of service (time-to-first token), carbon emissions, water usage, and energy costs. The framework utilizes a machine learning (ML) based metaheuristic to enhance the sustainability of LLM hosting across geo-distributed cloud datacenters.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23564v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models effectively using reinforcement learning (RL) remains a crucial challenge. Existing approaches primarily adopt two contrasting advantage estimation granularities: Token-level methods (e.g., PPO) aim to provide the fine-grained advantage signals but suffer from inaccurate estimation due to difficulties in training an accurate critic model. On the other extreme, trajectory-level methods (e.g., GRPO) solely rely on a coarse-grained advantage signal from the final reward, leading to imprecise credit assignment. To address these limitations, we propose Segment Policy Optimization (SPO), a novel RL framework that leverages segment-level advantage estimation at an intermediate granularity, achieving a better balance by offering more precise credit assignment than trajectory-level methods and requiring fewer estimation points than token-level methods, enabling accurate advantage estimation based on Monte Carlo (MC) without a critic model. SPO features three components with novel strategies: (1) flexible segment partition; (2) accurate segment advantage estimation; and (3) policy optimization using segment advantages, including a novel probability-mask strategy. We further instantiate SPO for two specific scenarios: (1) SPO-chain for short chain-of-thought (CoT), featuring novel cutpoint-based partition and chain-based advantage estimation, achieving $6$-$12$ percentage point improvements in accuracy over PPO and GRPO on GSM8K. (2) SPO-tree for long CoT, featuring novel tree-based advantage estimation, which significantly reduces the cost of MC estimation, achieving $7$-$11$ percentage point improvements over GRPO on MATH500 under 2K and 4K context evaluation.

For example, an origami-making station in the waiting area of a restaurant may be both surprising and enjoyable for a customer who is passionate about paper crafts. Similarly, an exhibit of 18th century harpsichords would be atypical for a hotel lobby and likely pique the interest of a guest who has a passion for Baroque music. Motivated by this insight, in this paper we introduce the new task of engineering serendipity through recommendations of items with atypical aspects. We describe an LLM-based system pipeline that extracts atypical aspects from item reviews, then estimates and aggregates their user-specific utility in a measure of serendipity potential that is used to rerank a list of items recommended to the user. To facilitate system development and evaluation, we introduce a dataset of Yelp reviews that are manually annotated with atypical aspects and a dataset of artificially generated user profiles, together with crowdsourced annotations of user-aspect utility values. Furthermore, we introduce a custom procedure for dynamic selection of in-context learning examples, which is shown to improve LLM-based judgments of atypicality and utility. Experimental evaluations show that serendipity-based rankings generated by the system are highly correlated with ground truth rankings for which serendipity scores are computed from manual annotations of atypical aspects and their user-dependent utility. Overall, we hope that the new recommendation task and the associated system presented in this paper catalyze further research into recommendation approaches that go beyond accuracy in their pursuit of enhanced user satisfaction.\n  The datasets and the code are made publicly available at https://github.com/ramituncc49er/ATARS .",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23584v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for timely, cost-effective last-mile delivery have increased interest in collaborative logistics. This research introduces a novel collaborative synchronized multi-platform vehicle routing problem with drones and robots (VRP-DR), where a fleet of $\\mathcal{M}$ trucks, $\\mathcal{N}$ drones and $\\mathcal{K}$ robots, cooperatively delivers parcels. Trucks serve as mobile platforms, enabling the launching, retrieving, and en-route charging of drones and robots, thereby addressing critical limitations such as restricted payload capacities, limited range, and battery constraints. The VRP-DR incorporates five realistic features: (1) multi-visit service per trip, (2) multi-trip operations, (3) flexible docking, allowing returns to the same or different trucks (4) cyclic and acyclic operations, enabling return to the same or different nodes; and (5) en-route charging, enabling drones and robots to recharge while being transported on the truck, maximizing operational efficiency by utilizing idle transit time. The VRP-DR is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) to minimize both operational costs and makespan. To overcome the computational challenges of solving large-scale instances, a scalable heuristic algorithm, FINDER (Flexible INtegrated Delivery with Energy Recharge), is developed, to provide efficient, near-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments across various instance sizes evaluate the performance of the MILP and heuristic approaches in terms of solution quality and computation time. The results demonstrate significant time savings of the combined delivery mode over the truck-only mode and substantial cost reductions from enabling multi-visits. The study also provides insights into the effects of en-route charging, docking flexibility, drone count, speed, and payload capacity on system performance.",

This paper provides a comprehensive study of rule-based visual RL using jigsaw puzzles as a structured experimental framework, revealing several key findings. \\textit{Firstly,} we find that MLLMs, initially performing near to random guessing on simple puzzles, achieve near-perfect accuracy and generalize to complex, unseen configurations through fine-tuning. \\textit{Secondly,} training on jigsaw puzzles can induce generalization to other visual tasks, with effectiveness tied to specific task configurations. \\textit{Thirdly,} MLLMs can learn and generalize with or without explicit reasoning, though open-source models often favor direct answering. Consequently, even when trained for step-by-step reasoning, they can ignore the thinking process in deriving the final answer. \\textit{Fourthly,} we observe that complex reasoning patterns appear to be pre-existing rather than emergent, with their frequency increasing alongside training and task difficulty. \\textit{Finally,} our results demonstrate that RL exhibits more effective generalization than Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and an initial SFT cold start phase can hinder subsequent RL optimization. Although these observations are based on jigsaw puzzles and may vary across other visual tasks, this research contributes a valuable piece of jigsaw to the larger puzzle of collective understanding rule-based visual RL and its potential in multimodal learning.

This paper addresses this critical issue by introducing DeepChest, a novel, computationally efficient and effective dynamic task-weighting framework specifically designed for multi-label chest X-ray (CXR) classification. Unlike existing heuristic or gradient-based methods that often incur substantial overhead, DeepChest leverages a performance-driven weighting mechanism based on effective analysis of task-specific loss trends. Given a network architecture (e.g., ResNet18), our model-agnostic approach adaptively adjusts task importance without requiring gradient access, thereby significantly reducing memory usage and achieving a threefold increase in training speed. It can be easily applied to improve various state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments on a large-scale CXR dataset demonstrate that DeepChest not only outperforms state-of-the-art MTL methods by 7% in overall accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in individual task losses, indicating improved generalization and effective mitigation of negative transfer. The efficiency and performance gains of DeepChest pave the way for more practical and robust deployment of deep learning in critical medical diagnostic applications.

While smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one. Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few samples.

We introduce grounded video tokenization, a paradigm that organizes tokens based on panoptic sub-object trajectories rather than fixed patches. Our method aligns with fundamental perceptual principles, ensuring that tokenization reflects scene complexity rather than video duration. We propose TrajViT, a video encoder that extracts object trajectories and converts them into semantically meaningful tokens, significantly reducing redundancy while maintaining temporal coherence. Trained with contrastive learning, TrajViT significantly outperforms space-time ViT (ViT3D) across multiple video understanding benchmarks, e.g., TrajViT outperforms ViT3D by a large margin of 6% top-5 recall in average at video-text retrieval task with 10x token deduction.

Persistent homology (PH), from the field of topological data analysis (TDA), demonstrates robustness and stability to data perturbations and addresses the limitation from traditional feature extraction approaches where a small change in input results in a large change in feature representation. Using PH, we store persistent topological and geometrical features in the form of the persistence barcode whereby large bars represent global topological features and small bars encapsulate geometrical information of the data. When multiple barcodes are computed from 2D or 3D medical images, two approaches can be used to construct the final topological feature vector in each dimension: aggregating persistence barcodes followed by featurization or concatenating topological feature vectors derived from each barcode. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse medical imaging datasets to compare the effects of the two aforementioned approaches on the performance of classification models. The results of this analysis indicate that feature concatenation preserves detailed topological information from individual barcodes, yields better classification performance and is therefore a preferred approach when conducting similar experiments.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23657v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Recent decoding methods improve the factuality of large language models~(LLMs) by refining how the next token is selected during generation. These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.",

However, most existing assessments focus on natural videos, overlooking synthetic videos, such as AI-generated content (AIGC). Meanwhile, some works in video generation rely on MLLMs to evaluate the quality of generated videos, but the capabilities of MLLMs on interpreting AIGC videos remain largely underexplored. To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark. Additionally, to investigate the practical applications of VF-Eval in improving video generation, we conduct an experiment, RePrompt, demonstrating that aligning MLLMs more closely with human feedback can benefit video generation.",

    "title": "CLDTracker: A Comprehensive Language Description for Visual Tracking",
    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23704v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: VOT remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision due to dynamic appearance changes, occlusions, and background clutter. Traditional trackers, relying primarily on visual cues, often struggle in such complex scenarios. Recent advancements in VLMs have shown promise in semantic understanding for tasks like open-vocabulary detection and image captioning, suggesting their potential for VOT. However, the direct application of VLMs to VOT is hindered by critical limitations: the absence of a rich and comprehensive textual representation that semantically captures the target object's nuances, limiting the effective use of language information; inefficient fusion mechanisms that fail to optimally integrate visual and textual features, preventing a holistic understanding of the target; and a lack of temporal modeling of the target's evolving appearance in the language domain, leading to a disconnect between the initial description and the object's subsequent visual changes. To bridge these gaps and unlock the full potential of VLMs for VOT, we propose CLDTracker, a novel Comprehensive Language Description framework for robust visual Tracking. Our tracker introduces a dual-branch architecture consisting of a textual and a visual branch. In the textual branch, we construct a rich bag of textual descriptions derived by harnessing the powerful VLMs such as CLIP and GPT-4V, enriched with semantic and contextual cues to address the lack of rich textual representation. Experiments on six standard VOT benchmarks demonstrate that CLDTracker achieves SOTA performance, validating the effectiveness of leveraging robust and temporally-adaptive vision-language representations for tracking.

However, conventional approaches that rely on centralized data collection or purely local training face limitations due to the large scale, high mobility, and heterogeneous data distributions inherent in inter-vehicle networks. To overcome these challenges, this paper explores Distributed Federated Learning (DFL), whereby vehicles collaboratively train deep learning models by exchanging model updates among one-hop neighbors and propagating models over multiple hops. Using the Vehicular Reference Misbehavior (VeReMi) Extension Dataset, we show that DFL can significantly improve classification accuracy across all vehicles compared to learning strictly with local data. Notably, vehicles with low individual accuracy see substantial accuracy gains through DFL, illustrating the benefit of knowledge sharing across the network. We further show that local training data size and time-varying network connectivity correlate strongly with the model's overall accuracy. We investigate DFL's resilience and vulnerabilities under attacks in multiple domains, namely wireless jamming and training data poisoning attacks. Our results reveal important insights into the vulnerabilities of DFL when confronted with multi-domain attacks, underlining the need for more robust strategies to secure DFL in vehicular networks.",

Clinicians typically follow a holistic approach for assessing the risk level of the patient and for deciding which lesions may be malignant and need to be excised, by considering the patient's medical history as well as the appearance of other lesions of the patient. Inspired by this, SLIMP combines the appearance and the metadata of individual skin lesions with patient-level metadata relating to their medical record and other clinically relevant information.

Focusing on this, for the first time, we explore the paradigm of learning-based agentic ML, where an LLM agent learns through interactive experimentation on ML tasks using online reinforcement learning (RL). To realize this, we propose a novel agentic ML training framework with three key components: (1) exploration-enriched fine-tuning, which enables LLM agents to generate diverse actions for enhanced RL exploration; (2) step-wise RL, which enables training on a single action step, accelerating experience collection and improving training efficiency; (3) an agentic ML-specific reward module, which unifies varied ML feedback signals into consistent rewards for RL optimization. Leveraging this framework, we train ML-Agent, driven by a 7B-sized Qwen-2.5 LLM for autonomous ML. Remarkably, despite being trained on merely 9 ML tasks, our 7B-sized ML-Agent outperforms the 671B-sized DeepSeek-R1 agent.

However, vanilla LoRA suffers from slow convergence speed and knowledge forgetting problems. Recent studies have leveraged the power of designed LoRA initialization, to enhance the fine-tuning efficiency, or to preserve knowledge in the pre-trained LLM. However, none of these works can address the two cases at the same time. To this end, we introduce Subspace-Constrained LoRA (SC-LoRA), a novel LoRA initialization framework engineered to navigate the trade-off between efficient fine-tuning and knowledge preservation. We achieve this by constraining the output of trainable LoRA adapters in a low-rank subspace, where the context information of fine-tuning data is most preserved while the context information of preserved knowledge is least retained, in a balanced way. Such constraint enables the trainable weights to primarily focus on the main features of fine-tuning data while avoiding damaging the preserved knowledge features. We provide theoretical analysis on our method, and conduct extensive experiments including safety preservation and world knowledge preservation, on various downstream tasks. In our experiments, SC-LoRA succeeds in delivering superior fine-tuning performance while markedly diminishing knowledge forgetting, surpassing contemporary LoRA initialization methods.",

While existing approaches typically frame this as a multi-objective optimization problem, they often overlook how humans actually make decisions. Research on bounded rationality suggests that human decision making follows satisficing strategies-optimizing primary objectives while ensuring others meet acceptable thresholds. To bridge this gap and operationalize the notion of satisficing alignment, we propose SITAlign: an inference time framework that addresses the multifaceted nature of alignment by maximizing a primary objective while satisfying threshold-based constraints on secondary criteria. We provide theoretical insights by deriving sub-optimality bounds of our satisficing based inference alignment approach. We empirically validate SITAlign's performance through extensive experimentation on multiple benchmarks. For instance, on the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset with the primary objective of maximizing helpfulness while ensuring a threshold on harmlessness, SITAlign outperforms the state-of-the-art multi objective decoding strategy by a margin of 22.3% in terms of GPT-4 win-tie rate for helpfulness reward while adhering to the threshold on harmlessness.",

Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models.

However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge.

In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning.

We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23759v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.23761v1 Announce Type: cross \nAbstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information.",

However, in complex decision-making tasks, pure LLM-based agents tend to exhibit intrinsic bias in their choice of actions, which is inherited from the model's training data and results in suboptimal performance. To develop strategic language agents, i.e., agents that generate flexible language actions and possess strong decision-making abilities, we propose a novel framework that powers LLM-based agents with reinforcement learning (RL). We consider Werewolf, a popular social deduction game, as a challenging testbed that emphasizes versatile communication and strategic gameplay. To mitigate the intrinsic bias in language actions, our agents use an LLM to perform deductive reasoning and generate a diverse set of action candidates. Then an RL policy trained to optimize the decision-making ability chooses an action from the candidates to play in the game. Extensive experiments show that our agents overcome the intrinsic bias and outperform existing LLM-based agents in the Werewolf game. We also conduct human-agent experiments and find that our agents achieve human-level performance and demonstrate strong strategic play.",

The goal of providing or seeking explanations is to achieve (better) 'understanding' on the part of the explainee. However, what it means to 'understand' is still not clearly defined, and the concept itself is rarely the subject of scientific investigation. This conceptual article aims to present a model of forms of understanding for XAI-explanations and beyond. From an interdisciplinary perspective bringing together computer science, linguistics, sociology, philosophy and psychology, a definition of understanding and its forms, assessment, and dynamics during the process of giving everyday explanations are explored. Two types of understanding are considered as possible outcomes of explanations, namely enabledness, 'knowing how' to do or decide something, and comprehension, 'knowing that' -- both in different degrees (from shallow to deep). Explanations regularly start with shallow understanding in a specific domain and can lead to deep comprehension and enabledness of the explanandum, which we see as a prerequisite for human users to gain agency. In this process, the increase of comprehension and enabledness are highly interdependent. Against the background of this systematization, special challenges of understanding in XAI are discussed.",

Traditionally, this task has demanded significant time and domain expertise to identify key Legal Facts and reach sound juridical conclusions. In addition, existing data with legal case similarities often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand the rationale behind relevance judgments. With the growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun investigating their potential in this domain. Nonetheless, the method of employing a general large language model for reliable relevance judgments in legal case retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap in research, we propose a novel few-shot approach where LLMs assist in generating expert-aligned interpretable relevance judgments. The proposed approach decomposes the judgment process into several stages, mimicking the workflow of human annotators and allowing for the flexible incorporation of expert reasoning to improve the accuracy of relevance judgments. Importantly, it also ensures interpretable data labeling, providing transparency and clarity in the relevance assessment process. Through a comparison of relevance judgments made by LLMs and human experts, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach can yield reliable and valid relevance assessments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that with minimal expert supervision, our approach enables a large language model to acquire case analysis expertise and subsequently transfers this ability to a smaller model via annotation-based knowledge distillation.",

In this work, we discover that large-scale 3D parallel training on those models leads to an imbalanced computation load across different devices. The vision and language parts are inherently heterogeneous: their data distribution and model architecture differ significantly, which affects distributed training efficiency. To address this issue, we rebalance the computational load from data, model, and memory perspectives, achieving more balanced computation across devices. Specifically, for the data, instances are grouped into new balanced mini-batches within and across devices. A search-based method is employed for the model to achieve a more balanced partitioning. For memory optimization, we adaptively adjust the re-computation strategy for each partition to utilize the available memory fully. These three perspectives are not independent but are closely connected, forming an omniverse balanced training framework. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our method. Compared with the open-source training code of InternVL-Chat, training time is reduced greatly, achieving about 1.8$\\times$ speed-up.

This chapter discusses how LLMs' abilities for general NL reasoning present novel opportunities to build highly personalized RSs -- which can effectively connect nuanced and diverse user preferences to items, potentially via interactive dialogues. To begin this discussion, we first present a taxonomy of the key data sources for language-driven recommendation, covering item descriptions, user-system interactions, and user profiles. We then proceed to fundamental techniques for LLM recommendation, reviewing the use of encoder-only and autoregressive LLM recommendation in both tuned and untuned settings. Afterwards, we move to multi-module recommendation architectures in which LLMs interact with components such as retrievers and RSs in multi-stage pipelines. This brings us to architectures for conversational recommender systems (CRSs), in which LLMs facilitate multi-turn dialogues where each turn presents an opportunity not only to make recommendations, but also to engage with the user in interactive preference elicitation, critiquing, and question-answering.",

To address this issue, we propose Logic-Enhanced Language Model Agents (LELMA), a framework that integrates LLMs with formal logic to enable validation and refinement of natural language reasoning. LELMA comprises three components: an LLM-Reasoner, an LLM-Translator, and a Solver, and employs autoformalization to translate reasoning into logic representations, which are then used to assess logical validity. Using game-theoretic scenarios such as the Prisoner's Dilemma as testbeds, we highlight the limitations of both less capable (Gemini 1.0 Pro) and advanced (GPT-4o) models in generating logically sound reasoning. LELMA achieves high accuracy in error detection and improves reasoning correctness via self-refinement, particularly in GPT-4o.

Meanwhile, agent-based reasoning systems require access to a comprehensive nonparametric knowledge base, which is often costly or not feasible for use in scientific and niche domains. We present Graph Inspired Veracity Extrapolation (GIVE), a novel reasoning method that merges parametric and non-parametric memories to improve accurate reasoning with minimal external input. GIVE guides the LLM agent to select the most pertinent expert data (observe), engage in query-specific divergent thinking (reflect), and then synthesize this information to produce the final output (speak). Extensive experiments demonstrated the following benefits of our framework: (1) GIVE boosts the performance of LLMs across various sizes. (2) In some scenarios, GIVE allows smaller LLMs to surpass larger, more sophisticated ones in scientific tasks (GPT3.5T + GIVE > GPT4). (3) GIVE is effective on scientific and open-domain assessments.

It emphasizes \"hard\" dispreferred responses -- those closely resembling preferred ones -- to enhance the model's rejection capabilities. By leveraging a single-sample Monte Carlo sampling strategy, HPS reduces computational overhead while maintaining alignment quality. Theoretically, HPS improves sample efficiency over existing PL methods and maximizes the reward margin between preferred and dispreferred responses, ensuring clearer distinctions.

To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic method for dataset featurization that provides precise control over the number of features extracted while maintaining compact and descriptive representations comparable to human labeling. Our method optimizes the selection of informative binary features by evaluating the ability of an LLM to reconstruct the original data using those features. We demonstrate its effectiveness in dataset modeling tasks and through two case studies: (1) Constructing a feature representation of jailbreak tactics that compactly captures both the effectiveness and diversity of a larger set of human-crafted attacks; and (2) automating the discovery of features that align with human preferences, achieving accuracy and robustness comparable to human-crafted features. Moreover, we show that the pipeline scales effectively, improving as additional features are sampled, making it suitable for large and diverse datasets.",

This bidirectional interface preserves the combinatorial efficiency and explainability of symbolic reasoning without sacrificing the adaptability of deep sequence models, and it permits a principled analysis that tracks how approximation errors from both planning and execution accumulate across the hierarchy.

After training the text-conditioned generalist policy, the agent can directly realize zero-shot text-to-decision generation in response to language instructions.

There are many reasons for this, including the fact that these models typically have nearly unbounded input and output spaces, typically do not have a well defined ground truth target, and typically exhibit strong feedback loops and prediction dependence based on context of previous model outputs. On top of these critical issues, we argue that the problems of leakage and contamination are in fact the most important and difficult issues to address for GenAI evaluations. Interestingly, the field of AI Competitions has developed effective measures and practices to combat leakage for the purpose of counteracting cheating by bad actors within a competition setting.

We further introduce an autonomous planning framework that completes the planning process by iteratively refining and expanding the hypertree-structured planning outlines.

Ensuring the faithfulness of these intermediate reasoning processes is crucial for reliable monitoring, interpretation, and effective control. In this paper, we propose a systematic counterfactual intervention framework to rigorously evaluate thinking draft faithfulness. Our approach focuses on two complementary dimensions: (1) Intra-Draft Faithfulness, which assesses whether individual reasoning steps causally influence subsequent steps and the final draft conclusion through counterfactual step insertions; and (2) Draft-to-Answer Faithfulness, which evaluates whether final answers are logically consistent with and dependent on the thinking draft, by perturbing the draft's concluding logic. We conduct extensive experiments across six state-of-the-art LRMs. Our findings show that current LRMs demonstrate selective faithfulness to intermediate reasoning steps and frequently fail to faithfully align with the draft conclusions.

TKG extrapolation aims to infer possible future facts based on known history, which has garnered significant attention in recent years. Some existing methods treat TKG as a sequence of independent subgraphs to model temporal evolution patterns, demonstrating impressive reasoning performance. However, they still have limitations: 1) In modeling subgraph semantic evolution, they usually neglect the internal structural interactions between subgraphs, which are actually crucial for encoding TKGs. 2) They overlook the potential smooth features that do not lead to semantic changes, which should be distinguished from the semantic evolution process. Therefore, we propose a novel Disentangled Multi-span Evolutionary Network (DiMNet) for TKG reasoning. Specifically, we design a multi-span evolution strategy that captures local neighbor features while perceiving historical neighbor semantic information, thus enabling internal interactions between subgraphs during the evolution process. To maximize the capture of semantic change patterns, we design a disentangle component that adaptively separates nodes' active and stable features, used to dynamically control the influence of historical semantics on future evolution. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world TKG datasets show that DiMNet demonstrates substantial performance in TKG reasoning, and outperforms the state-of-the-art up to 22.7% in MRR.",

Overrefusal typically stems from over-conservative safety alignment, causing models to treat many reasonable prompts as potentially risky. To systematically understand this issue, we probe and leverage the models'safety decision boundaries to analyze and mitigate overrefusal. Our findings reveal that overrefusal is closely tied to misalignment at these boundary regions, where models struggle to distinguish subtle differences between benign and harmful content. Building on these insights, we present RASS, an automated framework for prompt generation and selection that strategically targets overrefusal prompts near the safety boundary. By harnessing steering vectors in the representation space, RASS efficiently identifies and curates boundary-aligned prompts, enabling more effective and targeted mitigation of overrefusal. This approach not only provides a more precise and interpretable view of model safety decisions but also seamlessly extends to multilingual scenarios.We have explored the safety decision boundaries of various LLMs and construct the MORBench evaluation set to facilitate robust assessment of model safety and helpfulness across multiple languages.

A plausible hypothesis is that DNNs achieve robust and accurate predictions by identifying multiple pieces of evidence from images. Thus, to test this hypothesis, this study proposed minimal sufficient views (MSVs). MSVs is defined as a set of minimal regions within an input image that are sufficient to preserve the prediction of DNNs, thus representing the evidence discovered by the DNN. We empirically demonstrated a strong correlation between the number of MSVs (i.e., the number of pieces of evidence) and the generalization performance of the DNN models. Remarkably, this correlation was found to hold within a single DNN as well as between different DNNs, including convolutional and transformer models. This suggested that a DNN model that makes its prediction based on more evidence has a higher generalization performance. We proposed a metric based on MSVs for DNN model selection that did not require label information. Consequently, we empirically showed that the proposed metric was less dependent on the degree of overfitting, rendering it a more reliable indicator of model performance than existing metrics, such as average confidence.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2405.17642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The growing complexity of AI systems has intensified the need for transparency through Explainable AI (XAI). Counterfactual explanations (CFs) offer actionable \"what-if\" scenarios on three levels: Local CFs providing instance-specific insights, Global CFs addressing broader trends, and Group-wise CFs (GWCFs) striking a balance and revealing patterns within cohesive groups. Despite the availability of methods for each granularity level, the field lacks a unified method that integrates these complementary approaches. We address this limitation by proposing a gradient-based optimization method for differentiable models that generates Local, Global, and Group-wise Counterfactual Explanations in a unified manner. We especially enhance GWCF generation by combining instance grouping and counterfactual generation into a single efficient process, replacing traditional two-step methods. Moreover, to ensure trustworthiness, we innovatively introduce the integration of plausibility criteria into the GWCF domain, making explanations both valid and realistic. Our results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in balancing validity, proximity, and plausibility while optimizing group granularity, with practical utility validated through practical use cases.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2405.20032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: With the exponential growth of video traffic, traditional video streaming systems are approaching their limits in compression efficiency and communication capacity. To further reduce bitrate while maintaining quality, we propose Promptus, a disruptive semantic communication system that streaming prompts instead of video content, which represents real-world video frames with a series of \"prompts\" for delivery and employs Stable Diffusion to generate videos at the receiver. To ensure that the generated video is pixel-aligned with the original video, a gradient descent-based prompt fitting framework is proposed. Further, a low-rank decomposition-based bitrate control algorithm is introduced to achieve adaptive bitrate. For inter-frame compression, an interpolation-aware fitting algorithm is proposed. Evaluations across various video genres demonstrate that, compared to H.265, Promptus can achieve more than a 4x bandwidth reduction while preserving the same perceptual quality. On the other hand, at extremely low bitrates, Promptus can enhance the perceptual quality by 0.139 and 0.118 (in LPIPS) compared to VAE and H.265, respectively, and decreases the ratio of severely distorted frames by 89.3% and 91.7%.

In this paper, we propose a novel Stochastic Diffusion (StochDiff) model which learns data-driven prior knowledge at each time step by utilizing the representational power of the stochastic latent spaces to model the variability of the multivariate time series data. The learnt prior knowledge helps the model to capture complex temporal dynamics and the inherent uncertainty of the data. This improves its ability to model highly stochastic time series data. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model on stochastic time series forecasting.

    "summary": "arXiv:2407.11500v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: The diagnostic accuracy and subjectivity of existing Knee Osteoarthritis (OA) ordinal grading systems has been a subject of on-going debate and concern. Existing automated solutions are trained to emulate these imperfect systems, whilst also being reliant on large annotated databases for fully-supervised training. This work proposes a three stage approach for automated continuous grading of knee OA that is built upon the principles of Anomaly Detection (AD); learning a robust representation of healthy knee X-rays and grading disease severity based on its distance to the centre of normality. In the first stage, SS-FewSOME is proposed, a self-supervised AD technique that learns the 'normal' representation, requiring only examples of healthy subjects and <3% of the labels that existing methods require. In the second stage, this model is used to pseudo label a subset of unlabelled data as 'normal' or 'anomalous', followed by denoising of pseudo labels with CLIP. The final stage involves retraining on labelled and pseudo labelled data using the proposed Dual Centre Representation Learning (DCRL) which learns the centres of two representation spaces; normal and anomalous. Disease severity is then graded based on the distance to the learned centres. The proposed methodology outperforms existing techniques by margins of up to 24% in terms of OA detection and the disease severity scores correlate with the Kellgren-Lawrence grading system at the same level as human expert performance.

The traditional setting limits each participant to one message at a time and requires constant human participation.

This paper proposes \\textbf{\\textsc{X-Turing}}, which enhances the original test with a \\textit{burst dialogue} pattern, allowing more dynamic exchanges using consecutive messages. It further reduces human workload by iteratively generating dialogues that simulate the long-term interaction between the agent and a human to compose the majority of the test process. With the \\textit{pseudo-dialogue} history, the agent then engages in a shorter dialogue with a real human, which is paired with a human-human conversation on the same topic to be judged using questionnaires. We introduce the \\textit{X-Turn Pass-Rate} metric to assess the human likeness of LLMs across varying durations. While LLMs like GPT-4 initially perform well, achieving pass rates of 51.9\\% and 38.9\\% during 3 turns and 10 turns of dialogues respectively, their performance drops as the dialogue progresses, which underscores the difficulty in maintaining consistency in the long term.",

Existing algorithms assume a small number of items with a sufficiently large number of copies, which ensures a good utility estimation for all item-agent pairs from noisy bandit feedback. However, this assumption may not hold in many real-life applications, for example, an online platform that has a large number of users (items) who use the platform's service providers (agents) only a few times (a few copies of items), which makes it difficult to accurately estimate utilities for all item-agent pairs. To address this, we assume utility is an unknown function of item-agent features. We then propose algorithms that model online fair division as a contextual bandit problem, with sub-linear regret guarantees. Our experimental results further validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.",

One major challenge of RLHF is the inaccuracy of the intermediate reward model, especially in the tasks that requires complex reasoning for the reward model to score a response. We find that the reliability of the reward model varies across responses assigned with different rewards. This motivates us to filter the samples whose rewards may be unreliable to improve the signal-to-noise ratio during policy learning, resulting in Policy Filtration for Proximal Policy Optimization (PF-PPO). To choose a proper policy filtering strategy, we use the coefficient of determination (R2) between the rewards and actual scores on filtered samples as the metrics to help us find promising strategies since it measures how well the rewards filtered by PF-PPO indicate real performance. We provide extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of PF-PPO in code generation and math reasoning tasks. In code generation, PF-PPO achieves the state-of-the-art performance of 7-billion-parameter models on HumanEval (+7.9%), MBPP (+0.7%), and LeetCode Contest (+10.0%) which is a more challenging benchmark created by us.

In light of this, Mamba has attracted attention for maintaining a constant inference size, with empirical evidence demonstrating that it can match Transformer performance in sequence modeling while significantly reducing computational costs. However, an open question remains: can Mamba always bring savings while achieving performance comparable to Transformers? In this paper, we focus on analyzing the expressive ability of Mamba to perform our defined COPY operation and Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning. First, inspired by the connection between Mamba and linear attention, we show that constant-sized Mamba may struggle to perform COPY operations while Transformers can handle them more easily. However, when the size of Mamba grows linearly with the input sequence length, it can accurately perform COPY, but in this case, Mamba no longer provides overhead savings. Based on this observation, we further analyze Mamba's ability to tackle CoT tasks, which can be described by the Dynamic Programming (DP) problems. Our findings suggest that to solve arbitrary DP problems, the total cost of Mamba is still comparable to standard Transformers. However, similar to efficient Transformers, when facing DP problems with favorable properties such as locality, Mamba can provide savings in overhead. Our experiments on the copy and CoT tasks further demonstrate Mamba's limitations compared to Transformers in learning these tasks.",

For high-dimensional visual data, it reduces redundancy and emphasizes key features for high-quality generation. Current visual tokenization methods rely on a traditional autoencoder framework, where the encoder compresses data into latent representations, and the decoder reconstructs the original input. In this work, we offer a new perspective by proposing denoising as decoding, shifting from single-step reconstruction to iterative refinement. Specifically, we replace the decoder with a diffusion process that iteratively refines noise to recover the original image, guided by the latents provided by the encoder. We evaluate our approach by assessing both reconstruction (rFID) and generation quality (FID), comparing it to state-of-the-art autoencoding approaches. By adopting iterative reconstruction through diffusion, our autoencoder, namely Epsilon-VAE, achieves high reconstruction quality, which in turn enhances downstream generation quality by 22% at the same compression rates or provides 2.3x inference speedup through increasing compression rates. We hope this work offers new insights into integrating iterative generation and autoencoding for improved compression and generation.",

In contrast, one-shot compression methods eliminate retraining cost, but struggle to achieve accuracy comparable to dense models. This paper presents SLIM, a new one-shot compression framework that holistically integrates hardware-friendly quantization, sparsity, and low-rank approximation into a unified process. First, we formulate the quantization process using a probabilistic approach (SLIM-Quant) that enables us to apply uniform quantization. Then, we use an existing one-shot pruning method to apply semi-structured sparsity on top of the quantized weights. Finally, to compensate for the introduced aggregated quantization and sparsity error, we use a novel saliency function with unique invertible and additive features that enables us to mathematically compute the value of low-rank adapters. SLIM improves model accuracy by up to 5.66% (LLaMA-2-7B) for 2:4 sparsity with 4-bit weight quantization, outperforming prior methods. Models compressed with SLIM achieve up to 4.3x and 3.8x on Nvidia RTX3060 and A100 GPUs, respectively. Additionally, they achieve up to 0.23x end-to-end memory reduction in comparison to their dense counterparts.

These large networks avoid overfitting by integrating components that induce a simplicity bias, guiding models toward simple and generalizable solutions. However, in deep RL, designing and scaling up networks have been less explored. Motivated by this opportunity, we present SimBa, an architecture designed to scale up parameters in deep RL by injecting a simplicity bias. SimBa consists of three components: (i) an observation normalization layer that standardizes inputs with running statistics, (ii) a residual feedforward block to provide a linear pathway from the input to output, and (iii) a layer normalization to control feature magnitudes. By scaling up parameters with SimBa, the sample efficiency of various deep RL algorithms-including off-policy, on-policy, and unsupervised methods-is consistently improved. Moreover, solely by integrating SimBa architecture into SAC, it matches or surpasses state-of-the-art deep RL methods with high computational efficiency across DMC, MyoSuite, and HumanoidBench.

With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance.

    "title": "SequentialBreak: Large Language Models Can be Fooled by Embedding Jailbreak Prompts into Sequential Prompt Chains",
    "summary": "arXiv:2411.06426v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: As the integration of the Large Language Models (LLMs) into various applications increases, so does their susceptibility to misuse, raising significant security concerns. Numerous jailbreak attacks have been proposed to assess the security defense of LLMs. Current jailbreak attacks mainly rely on scenario camouflage, prompt obfuscation, prompt optimization, and prompt iterative optimization to conceal malicious prompts. In particular, sequential prompt chains in a single query can lead LLMs to focus on certain prompts while ignoring others, facilitating context manipulation. This paper introduces SequentialBreak, a novel jailbreak attack that exploits this vulnerability. We discuss several scenarios, not limited to examples like Question Bank, Dialog Completion, and Game Environment, where the harmful prompt is embedded within benign ones that can fool LLMs into generating harmful responses. The distinct narrative structures of these scenarios show that SequentialBreak is flexible enough to adapt to various prompt formats beyond those discussed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SequentialBreak uses only a single query to achieve a substantial gain of attack success rate over existing baselines against both open-source and closed-source models. Through our research, we highlight the urgent need for more robust and resilient safeguards to enhance LLM security and prevent potential misuse.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.17296v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in graph representation learning over popular graph neural networks (GNNs). However, self--attention, the core module of GTs, preserves only low-frequency signals in graph features, leading to ineffectiveness in capturing other important signals like high-frequency ones. Some recent GT models help alleviate this issue, but their flexibility and expressiveness are still limited since the filters they learn are fixed on predefined graph spectrum or spectral order. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Graph Fourier Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (GrokFormer), a novel GT model that learns highly expressive spectral filters with adaptive graph spectrum and spectral order through a Fourier series modeling over learnable activation functions. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that the proposed GrokFormer filter offers better expressiveness than other spectral methods. Comprehensive experiments on 10 real-world node classification datasets across various domains, scales, and graph properties, as well as 5 graph classification datasets, show that GrokFormer outperforms state-of-the-art GTs and GNNs.

    "summary": "arXiv:2411.18212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.",

Therefore, it can be hard for practitioners to infer which GNN model can generalize well to graphs from their domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel cross-domain pretraining framework, \"one model for one graph,\" which overcomes the limitations of previous approaches that failed to use a single GNN to capture diverse graph patterns across domains with significant gaps. Specifically, we pretrain a bank of expert models, with each one corresponding to a specific dataset. When inferring to a new graph, gating functions choose a subset of experts to effectively integrate prior model knowledge while avoiding negative transfer.

These models are commonly trained in two stages: first, a data compressor is trained, and in a subsequent training stage a flow matching generative model is trained in the latent space of the data compressor. This two-stage paradigm sets obstacles for unifying models across data domains, as hand-crafted compressors architectures are used for different data modalities. To this end, we introduce INRFlow, a domain-agnostic approach to learn flow matching transformers directly in ambient space. Drawing inspiration from INRs, we introduce a conditionally independent point-wise training objective that enables INRFlow to make predictions continuously in coordinate space. Our empirical results demonstrate that INRFlow effectively handles different data modalities such as images, 3D point clouds and protein structure data, achieving strong performance in different domains and outperforming comparable approaches. INRFlow is a promising step towards domain-agnostic flow matching generative models that can be trivially adopted in different data domains.",

This study introduces a stepwise data-driven framework for discovering fractional differential equations (FDEs) directly from data. FDEs, known for their capacity to model non-local dynamics with fewer parameters than integer-order derivatives, can represent complex systems with long-range interactions. Our framework applies deep neural networks as surrogate models for denoising and reconstructing sparse and noisy observations while using Gaussian-Jacobi quadrature to handle the challenges posed by singularities in fractional derivatives. To optimize both the sparse coefficients and fractional order, we employ an alternating optimization approach that combines sparse regression with global optimization techniques. We validate the framework across various datasets, including synthetic anomalous diffusion data, experimental data on the creep behavior of frozen soils, and single-particle trajectories modeled by L\\'{e}vy motion.

    "summary": "arXiv:2412.12559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We introduce EXIT, an extractive context compression framework that enhances both the effectiveness and efficiency of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in question answering (QA). Current RAG systems often struggle when retrieval models fail to rank the most relevant documents, leading to the inclusion of more context at the expense of latency and accuracy. While abstractive compression methods can drastically reduce token counts, their token-by-token generation process significantly increases end-to-end latency. Conversely, existing extractive methods reduce latency but rely on independent, non-adaptive sentence selection, failing to fully utilize contextual information. EXIT addresses these limitations by classifying sentences from retrieved documents - while preserving their contextual dependencies - enabling parallelizable, context-aware extraction that adapts to query complexity and retrieval quality. Our evaluations on both single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks show that EXIT consistently surpasses existing compression methods and even uncompressed baselines in QA accuracy, while also delivering substantial reductions in inference time and token count. By improving both effectiveness and efficiency, EXIT provides a promising direction for developing scalable, high-quality QA solutions in RAG pipelines.

It becomes important to assess the risks of LLMs before the general public use them on social media platforms to avoid any adverse impacts. Unlike obvious nonsensical text strings that safety systems can easily catch, our work reveals that human-readable situation-driven adversarial full-prompts that leverage situational context are effective but much harder to detect. We found that skilled attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities in open-source and proprietary LLMs to make a malicious user query safe for LLMs, resulting in generating a harmful response. This raises an important question about the vulnerabilities of LLMs. To measure the robustness against human-readable attacks, which now present a potent threat, our research makes three major contributions. First, we developed attacks that use movie scripts as situational contextual frameworks, creating natural-looking full-prompts that trick LLMs into generating harmful content. Second, we developed a method to transform gibberish adversarial text into readable, innocuous content that still exploits vulnerabilities when used within the full-prompts. Finally, we enhanced the AdvPrompter framework with p-nucleus sampling to generate diverse human-readable adversarial texts that significantly improve attack effectiveness against models like GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 and Gemma-7b. Our findings show that these systems can be manipulated to operate beyond their intended ethical boundaries when presented with seemingly normal prompts that contain hidden adversarial elements. By identifying these vulnerabilities, we aim to drive the development of more robust safety mechanisms that can withstand sophisticated attacks in real-world applications.",

The dataset is based on the prototypical task of automated claim verification, for which automated retrieval of real-world evidence is crucial. We compare DRUID to synthetic datasets (CounterFact, ConflictQA) and find that artificial datasets often fail to represent the complexity and diversity of realistically retrieved context. We show that synthetic datasets exaggerate context characteristics rare in real retrieved data, which leads to inflated context utilisation results, as measured by our novel ACU score. Moreover, while previous work has mainly focused on singleton context characteristics to explain context utilisation, correlations between singleton context properties and ACU on DRUID are surprisingly small compared to other properties related to context source.

However, existing approaches primarily focus on text, with some recent advancements considering images, and they largely overlook videos, a rich source of multimodal knowledge capable of representing contextual details more effectively than any other modality. While very recent studies explore the use of videos in response generation, they either predefine query-associated videos without retrieval or convert videos into textual descriptions losing multimodal richness. To tackle these, we introduce VideoRAG, a framework that not only dynamically retrieves videos based on their relevance with queries but also utilizes both visual and textual information. The operation of VideoRAG is powered by recent Large Video Language Models (LVLMs), which enable the direct processing of video content to represent it for retrieval and the seamless integration of retrieved videos jointly with queries for response generation. Also, inspired by that the context size of LVLMs may not be sufficient to process all frames in extremely long videos and not all frames are equally important, we introduce a video frame selection mechanism to extract the most informative subset of frames, along with a strategy to extract textual information from videos (as it can aid the understanding of video content) when their subtitles are not available.

However, these attribution methods are studied and applied rather independently, resulting in a fragmented landscape of methods and terminology. This position paper argues that feature, data, and component attribution methods share fundamental similarities, and a unified view of them benefits both interpretability and broader AI research. To this end, we first analyze popular methods for these three types of attributions and present a unified view demonstrating that these seemingly distinct methods employ similar techniques (such as perturbations, gradients, and linear approximations) over different aspects and thus differ primarily in their perspectives rather than techniques. Then, we demonstrate how this unified view enhances understanding of existing attribution methods, highlights shared concepts and evaluation criteria among these methods, and leads to new research directions both in interpretability research, by addressing common challenges and facilitating cross-attribution innovation, and in AI more broadly, with applications in model editing, steering, and regulation.",

It introduces a ReAct-based agent process for stepwise logical form generation with KB environment exploration. Moreover, it employs MCTS, a heuristic search method driven by policy and reward models, to balance agentic exploration's performance and search space. With heuristic exploration, KBQA-o1 generates high-quality annotations for further improvement by incremental fine-tuning. Experimental results show that KBQA-o1 outperforms previous low-resource KBQA methods with limited annotated data, boosting Llama-3.1-8B model's GrailQA F1 performance to 78.5% compared to 48.5% of the previous sota method with GPT-3.5-turbo.

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.01179v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, are commonly used to adapt LLMs. However, the effectiveness of standard PEFT methods is limited in low-resource scenarios with only a few hundred examples. Recent advances in interpretability research have inspired the emergence of activation editing (or steering) techniques, which modify the activations of specific model components. Due to their extremely small parameter counts, these methods show promise for small datasets. However, their performance is highly dependent on identifying the correct modules to edit and often lacks stability across different datasets. In this paper, we propose Joint Localization and Activation Editing (JoLA), a method that jointly learns (1) which heads in the Transformer to edit (2) whether the intervention should be additive, multiplicative, or both and (3) the intervention parameters themselves - the vectors applied as additive offsets or multiplicative scalings to the head output. Through evaluations on three benchmarks spanning commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding, and natural language generation, we demonstrate that JoLA consistently outperforms existing methods.

It finds its applications in various fields such as domain translation, image super-resolution, computational biology and others. Among the existing OT approaches, of considerable interest are adversarial minimax solvers based on semi-dual formulations of OT problems. While promising, these methods lack theoretical investigation from a statistical learning perspective. Our work fills this gap by establishing upper bounds on the generalization error of an approximate OT map recovered by the minimax quadratic OT solver. Importantly, the bounds we derive depend solely on some standard statistical and mathematical properties of the considered functional classes (neural nets). While our analysis focuses on the quadratic OT, we believe that similar bounds could be derived for general OT case, paving the promising direction for future research.",

Inspired by Speculative Decoding--where a small proposal model generates tokens sequentially, and a larger target model verifies them in parallel, our approach builds on two key insights: (1) the verification distribution can be the combined distribution of both the proposal and target models, and (2) alternating each model as the proposer and verifier can further enhance efficiency. We generalize this method to collaboration among n models and theoretically prove that CoS is never slower than standard collaborative decoding, typically achieving faster speed.

Traditional path planning methods fail to incorporate these detailed wake structures, resulting in increased energy consumption, reduced control stability, and heightened safety risks. This paper presents a novel wake-informed, 3D path planning approach that fully integrates localized wake effects and global currents into the planning algorithm. Two variants of the A* algorithm - a current-informed planner and a wake-informed planner - are created to assess its validity and two neural network models are then trained to approximate these planners for real-time applications. Both the A* planners and NN models are evaluated using important metrics such as energy expenditure, path length, and encounters with high-velocity and turbulent regions. The results demonstrate a wake-informed A* planner consistently achieves the lowest energy expenditure and minimizes encounters with high-velocity regions, reducing energy consumption by up to 11.3%. The neural network models are observed to offer computational speedup of 6 orders of magnitude, but exhibit 4.51 - 19.79% higher energy expenditures and 9.81 - 24.38% less optimal paths. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating detailed wake structures into traditional path planning algorithms and the benefits of neural network approximations to enhance energy efficiency and operational safety for AUVs in complex 3D domains.",

We evaluate SPRI on three tasks, and show that 1) SPRI can derive principles in a complex domain-specific task that leads to on-par performance as expert-crafted ones; 2) SPRI-generated principles lead to instance-specific rubrics that outperform prior LLM-as-a-judge frameworks; 3) using SPRI to generate synthetic SFT data leads to substantial improvement on truthfulness.

Building on recent advances in feature learning, we develop an effective, scalable approach for extracting linear representations of general concepts in large-scale AI models (language models, vision-language models, and reasoning models). We show how these representations enable model steering, through which we expose vulnerabilities, mitigate misaligned behaviors, and improve model capabilities. Additionally, we demonstrate that concept representations are remarkably transferable across human languages and combinable to enable multi-concept steering. Through quantitative analysis across hundreds of concepts, we find that newer, larger models are more steerable and steering can improve model capabilities beyond standard prompting. We show how concept representations are effective for monitoring misaligned content (hallucinations, toxic content). We demonstrate that predictive models built using concept representations are more accurate for monitoring misaligned content than using models that judge outputs directly. Together, our results illustrate the power of using internal representations to map the knowledge in AI models, advance AI safety, and improve model capabilities.",

With large language models (LLMs) crossing critical reliability thresholds for a growing slate of capabilities, there is an increasing effort to decompose systems into sets of LLM-based agents, each of whom can be delegated sub-tasks. However, this decomposition (even when automated) is often intuitive, e.g., based on how a human might assign roles to members of a human team. How close are these role decompositions to optimal? This position paper argues that asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives is needed to reason about the efficiency of such decomposed systems, and that insights from such analysis will unlock opportunities for scaling them. By treating the LLM forward pass as the atomic unit of computational cost, one can separate out the (often opaque) inner workings of a particular LLM from the inherent efficiency of how a set of LLMs are orchestrated to solve hard problems. In other words, if we want to scale the deployment of LLMs to the limit, instead of anthropomorphizing LLMs, asymptotic analysis with LLM primitives should be used to reason about and develop more powerful decompositions of large problems into LLM agents.",

Nevertheless, existing literature on behavior-regularized RL primarily focuses on explicit policy parameterizations, such as Gaussian policies. Consequently, it remains unclear how to extend this framework to more advanced policy parameterizations, such as diffusion models. In this paper, we introduce BDPO, a principled behavior-regularized RL framework tailored for diffusion-based policies, thereby combining the expressive power of diffusion policies and the robustness provided by regularization. The key ingredient of our method is to calculate the Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization analytically as the accumulated discrepancies in reverse-time transition kernels along the diffusion trajectory. By integrating the regularization, we develop an efficient two-time-scale actor-critic RL algorithm that produces the optimal policy while respecting the behavior constraint. Comprehensive evaluations conducted on synthetic 2D tasks and continuous control tasks from the D4RL benchmark validate its effectiveness and superior performance.",

The resulting $J_2$ (jailbreaking-to-jailbreak) attackers can effectively jailbreak the safeguard of target models using various strategies, both created by themselves or from expert human red teamers. In doing so, we show their strong but under-researched jailbreaking capabilities.

Existing approaches aiming to improve faithfulness primarily focus on enhancing the utilization of external context, but often overlook the persistent influence of internal parametric knowledge during generation. In this work, we investigate the internal mechanisms behind unfaithful generation and identify a subset of mid-to-deep feed-forward networks (FFNs) that are disproportionately activated in such cases. Building on this insight, we propose Parametric Knowledge Muting through FFN Suppression (ParamMute), a framework that improves contextual faithfulness by suppressing the activation of unfaithfulness-associated FFNs and calibrating the model toward retrieved knowledge. To evaluate our approach, we introduce CoFaithfulQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate faithfulness in scenarios where internal knowledge conflicts with accurate external evidence. Experimental results show that ParamMute significantly enhances faithfulness across both CoFaithfulQA and the established ConFiQA benchmark, achieving substantial reductions in reliance on parametric memory.

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.16091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Edge inference (EI) has emerged as a promising paradigm to address the growing limitations of cloud-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) inference services, such as high response latency, limited scalability, and severe data privacy exposure. However, deploying DNN models on resource-constrained edge devices introduces additional challenges, including limited computation/storage resources, dynamic service demands, and heightened privacy risks. To tackle these issues, this paper presents a novel privacy-aware optimization framework that jointly addresses DNN model deployment, user-server association, and model partitioning, with the goal of minimizing long-term average inference delay under resource and privacy constraints. The problem is formulated as a complex, NP-hard stochastic optimization. To efficiently handle system dynamics and computational complexity, we employ a Lyapunov-based approach to transform the long-term objective into tractable per-slot decisions. Furthermore, we introduce a coalition formation game to enable adaptive user-server association and design a greedy algorithm for model deployment within each coalition. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces inference delay and consistently satisfies privacy constraints, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse scenarios.",

Research on AVS suffers from data scarcity due to the high cost of fine-grained manual annotations. Recent works attempt to overcome the challenge of limited data by leveraging the vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), prompting it with audio to enhance its ability to segment sounding source objects. While this approach alleviates the model's burden on understanding visual modality by utilizing knowledge of pre-trained SAM, it does not address the fundamental challenge of learning audio-visual correspondence with limited data. To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{AV2T-SAM}, a novel framework that bridges audio features with the text embedding space of pre-trained text-prompted SAM. Our method leverages multimodal correspondence learned from rich text-image paired datasets to enhance audio-visual alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature, $\\mathbf{\\textit{\\textbf{f}}_{CLIP} \\odot \\textit{\\textbf{f}}_{CLAP}}$, which emphasizes shared semantics of audio and visual modalities while filtering irrelevant noise. Our approach outperforms existing methods on the AVSBench dataset by effectively utilizing pre-trained segmentation models and cross-modal semantic alignment.

However, most existing methods treat the LLM and the retriever as separate modules, overlooking the alignment between generation and ranking objectives. In this work, we propose ExpandR, a unified LLM-augmented dense retrieval framework that jointly optimizes both the LLM and the retriever. ExpandR employs the LLM to generate semantically rich query expansions, which are leveraged to enhance the retriever's training. Simultaneously, the LLM is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), guided by a carefully designed reward function that balances retrieval effectiveness and generation consistency. This joint optimization paradigm enables mutual adaptation between the LLM and the retriever, resulting in query expansions that are both informative and well-suited for retrieval. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show that ExpandR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving more than a 5% improvement in retrieval performance.

    "summary": "arXiv:2502.18710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Understanding convergent learning -- the degree to which independently trained neural systems -- whether multiple artificial networks or brains and models -- arrive at similar internal representations -- is crucial for both neuroscience and AI. Yet, the literature remains narrow in scope -- typically examining just a handful of models with one dataset, relying on one alignment metric, and evaluating networks at a single post-training checkpoint. We present a large-scale audit of convergent learning, spanning dozens of vision models and thousands of layer-pair comparisons, to close these long-standing gaps. First, we pit three alignment families against one another -- linear regression (affine-invariant), orthogonal Procrustes (rotation-/reflection-invariant), and permutation/soft-matching (unit-order-invariant). We find that orthogonal transformations align representations nearly as effectively as more flexible linear ones, and although permutation scores are lower, they significantly exceed chance, indicating a privileged representational basis. Tracking convergence throughout training further shows that nearly all eventual alignment crystallizes within the first epoch -- well before accuracy plateaus -- indicating it is largely driven by shared input statistics and architectural biases, not by the final task solution. Finally, when models are challenged with a battery of out-of-distribution images, early layers remain tightly aligned, whereas deeper layers diverge in proportion to the distribution shift. These findings fill critical gaps in our understanding of representational convergence, with implications for neuroscience and AI.",

Despite impressive advancements, this research area faces three key challenges. Firstly, the limited size of existing datasets impedes insights into modern battery life data. Secondly, most datasets are restricted to small-capacity lithium-ion batteries tested under a narrow range of diversity in labs, raising concerns about the generalizability of findings. Thirdly, inconsistent and limited benchmarks across studies obscure the effectiveness of baselines and leave it unclear if models popular in other time series fields are effective for BLP. To address these challenges, we propose BatteryLife, a comprehensive dataset and benchmark for BLP. BatteryLife integrates 16 datasets, offering a 2.5 times sample size compared to the previous largest dataset, and provides the most diverse battery life resource with batteries from 8 formats, 59 chemical systems, 9 operating temperatures, and 421 charge/discharge protocols, including both laboratory and industrial tests. Notably, BatteryLife is the first to release battery life datasets of zinc-ion batteries, sodium-ion batteries, and industry-tested large-capacity lithium-ion batteries. With the comprehensive dataset, we revisit the effectiveness of baselines popular in this and other time series fields. Furthermore, we propose CyclePatch, a plug-in technique that can be employed in various neural networks. Extensive benchmarking of 18 methods reveals that models popular in other time series fields can be unsuitable for BLP, and CyclePatch consistently improves model performance establishing state-of-the-art benchmarks.

This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2503.08250v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: While recent advancements in generative modeling have significantly improved text-image alignment, some residual misalignment between text and image representations still remains. Some approaches address this issue by fine-tuning models in terms of preference optimization, etc., which require tailored datasets. Orthogonal to these methods, we revisit the challenge from the perspective of representation alignment-an approach that has gained popularity with the success of REPresentation Alignment (REPA). We first argue that conventional text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, typically trained on paired image and text data (i.e., positive pairs) by minimizing score matching or flow matching losses, is suboptimal from the standpoint of representation alignment. Instead, a better alignment can be achieved through contrastive learning that leverages existing dataset as both positive and negative pairs. To enable efficient alignment with pretrained models, we propose SoftREPA- a lightweight contrastive fine-tuning strategy that leverages soft text tokens for representation alignment. This approach improves alignment with minimal computational overhead by adding fewer than 1M trainable parameters to the pretrained model. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that our method explicitly increases the mutual information between text and image representations, leading to enhanced semantic consistency. Experimental results across text-to-image generation and text-guided image editing tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the semantic consistency of T2I generative models.",

However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code.

Frameworks like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and the new European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) aim to standardize ESG reporting, yet generating comprehensive reports remains challenging due to the considerable length of ESG documents and variability in company reporting styles. To facilitate ESG report automation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems can be employed, but their development is hindered by a lack of labeled data suitable for training retrieval models. In this paper, we leverage an underutilized source of weak supervision -- the disclosure content index found in past ESG reports -- to create a comprehensive dataset, ESG-CID, for both GRI and ESRS standards. By extracting mappings between specific disclosure requirements and corresponding report sections, and refining them using a Large Language Model as a judge, we generate a robust training and evaluation set. We benchmark popular embedding models on this dataset and show that fine-tuning BERT-based models can outperform commercial embeddings and leading public models, even under temporal data splits for cross-report style transfer from GRI to ESRS.

Despite this success, the training data of LVLMs still suffers from Long-Tail (LT) problems, where the data distribution is highly imbalanced. Previous works have mainly focused on traditional VLM architectures, i.e., CLIP or ViT, and specific tasks such as recognition and classification. Nevertheless, the exploration of LVLM (e.g. LLaVA) and more general tasks (e.g. Visual Question Answering and Visual Reasoning) remains under-explored. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth analysis of the LT issues in LVLMs and identify two core causes: the overrepresentation of head concepts and the underrepresentation of tail concepts. Based on the above observation, we propose an $\\textbf{A}$daptive $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{R}$efinement Framework ($\\textbf{ADR}$), which consists of two stages: $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{R}$ebalancing ($\\textbf{DR}$) and $\\textbf{D}$ata $\\textbf{S}$ynthesis ($\\textbf{DS}$).

To ensure broad coverage, we chose abnormalities that encompass most of the finding types from CT reports. Our approach employs a specialized chain-of-thought prompting strategy for a locally-run LLM using sentence extraction and multiple-choice questions in a tree-based decision system. We demonstrate that the LLM can extract several abnormality types across abdominal organs with an average F1 score of 0.89, significantly outperforming competing labelers and humans. Additionally, we show that extraction of urgency labels achieved performance comparable to human annotations.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.00186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Spurious correlations are unstable statistical associations that hinder robust decision-making. Conventional wisdom suggests that models relying on such correlations will fail to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD), especially under strong distribution shifts. However, empirical evidence challenges this view as naive in-distribution empirical risk minimizers often achieve the best OOD accuracy across popular OOD generalization benchmarks. In light of these results, we propose a different perspective: many widely used benchmarks for evaluating robustness to spurious correlations are misspecified. Specifically, they fail to include shifts in spurious correlations that meaningfully impact OOD generalization, making them unsuitable for evaluating the benefit of removing such correlations. We establish conditions under which a distribution shift can reliably assess a model's reliance on spurious correlations. Crucially, under these conditions, we should not observe a strong positive correlation between in-distribution and OOD accuracy, often called \"accuracy on the line.\" Yet, most state-of-the-art benchmarks exhibit this pattern, suggesting they do not effectively assess robustness. Our findings expose a key limitation in current benchmarks used to evaluate domain generalization algorithms, that is, models designed to avoid spurious correlations. We highlight the need to rethink how robustness to spurious correlations is assessed, identify well-specified benchmarks the field should prioritize, and enumerate strategies for designing future benchmarks that meaningfully reflect robustness under distribution shift.",

EBD is rigorously grounded in the stochastic orthogonality property of Minimum Mean Square Error estimators. This fundamental principle states that the error of an optimal estimator is orthogonal to functions of the input. Guided by this insight, EBD defines layerwise loss functions that directly penalize correlations between layer activations and output errors, thereby establishing a principled foundation for error broadcasting. This theoretically sound mechanism naturally leads to the experimentally observed three-factor learning rule and integrates with biologically plausible frameworks to enhance performance and plausibility.

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: We propose a combinatorial and graph-theoretic theory of dropout by modeling training as a random walk over a high-dimensional graph of binary subnetworks. Each node represents a masked version of the network, and dropout induces stochastic traversal across this space. We define a subnetwork contribution score that quantifies generalization and show that it varies smoothly over the graph. Using tools from spectral graph theory, PAC-Bayes analysis, and combinatorics, we prove that generalizing subnetworks form large, connected, low-resistance clusters, and that their number grows exponentially with network width. This reveals dropout as a mechanism for sampling from a robust, structured ensemble of well-generalizing subnetworks with built-in redundancy. Extensive experiments validate every theoretical claim across diverse architectures. Together, our results offer a unified foundation for understanding dropout and suggest new directions for mask-guided regularization and subnetwork optimization.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2504.14945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) demonstrate that sophisticated behaviors such as multi-step reasoning and self-reflection can emerge via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards~(\\textit{RLVR}). However, existing \\textit{RLVR} approaches are inherently ``on-policy'', limiting learning to a model's own outputs and failing to acquire reasoning abilities beyond its initial capabilities. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{LUFFY} (\\textbf{L}earning to reason \\textbf{U}nder o\\textbf{FF}-polic\\textbf{Y} guidance), a framework that augments \\textit{RLVR} with off-policy reasoning traces. LUFFY dynamically balances imitation and exploration by combining off-policy demonstrations with on-policy rollouts during training. Specifically, LUFFY combines the Mixed-Policy GRPO framework, which has a theoretically guaranteed convergence rate, alongside policy shaping via regularized importance sampling to avoid superficial and rigid imitation during mixed-policy training. Compared with previous RLVR methods, LUFFY achieves an over \\textbf{+6.4} average gain across six math benchmarks and an advantage of over \\textbf{+6.2} points in out-of-distribution tasks. Most significantly, we show that LUFFY successfully trains weak models in scenarios where on-policy RLVR completely fails. These results provide compelling evidence that LUFFY transcends the fundamental limitations of on-policy RLVR and demonstrates the great potential of utilizing off-policy guidance in RLVR.",

To address the limitations of existing approaches, this paper proposes coordination field agentic system for coordinating heterogeneous UAV swarms in complex urban scenarios. In this system, large language models (LLMs) is responsible for interpreting high-level human instructions and converting them into executable commands for the UAV swarms, such as patrol and target tracking. Subsequently, a Coordination field mechanism is proposed to guide UAV motion and task selection, enabling decentralized and adaptive allocation of emergent tasks. A total of 50 rounds of comparative testing were conducted across different models in a 2D simulation space to evaluate their performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves superior performance in terms of task coverage, response time, and adaptability to dynamic changes.",

This study discusses the practicalities of using human judgment via a case study at eBay Advertising and demonstrate that using LLM-as-a-judge en-masse as a scalable proxy for seller judgment to train our relevance models achieves a better harmony across the three systems -- provided that they are bound by a meticulous evaluation framework grounded in business metrics.",

Existing methods capture interest similarity between users to filter out interest-irrelevant relations in social networks that inevitably decrease recommendation accuracy, however, limited research has a focus on the mutual influence of semantic information between the social network and the user-item interaction network for further improving social recommendation.

Then, a graph convolutional network and a tensor convolutional network are employed to capture user's item preference and social preference, respectively. Considering the different semantic information in the user-item interaction network and the social network, a bi-semantic coordination loss is proposed to model the mutual influence of semantic information. To alleviate the interference of interest-irrelevant relations on multi-semantic modeling, we further use Bayesian posterior probability to mine potential social relations to replace social noise. Finally, the sliding window mechanism is utilized to update the social tensor as the input for the next iteration.

Biomedical text especially has seen growing development of FMs. While TCGA contains free-text data as pathology reports, these have been historically underutilized. Here, we investigate the feasibility of training classical, multimodal survival models over zero-shot embeddings extracted by FMs. We show the ease and additive effect of multimodal fusion, outperforming unimodal models.

To address these issues, we propose a novel training method that integrates a bidirectional chains of thought and a reward mechanism. This method is built upon ICH-Qwen, a large language model specifically designed for the field of intangible cultural heritage. The proposed method enables the model to not only perform forward reasoning but also enhances the accuracy of the generated answers by utilizing reverse questioning and reverse reasoning to activate the model's latent knowledge. Additionally, a reward mechanism is introduced during training to optimize the decision-making process. This mechanism improves the quality of the model's outputs through structural and content evaluations with different weighting schemes. We conduct comparative experiments on ICH-Qwen, with results demonstrating that our method outperforms 0-shot, step-by-step reasoning, knowledge distillation, and question augmentation methods in terms of accuracy, Bleu-4, and Rouge-L scores on the question-answering task. Furthermore, the paper highlights the effectiveness of combining the bidirectional chains of thought and reward mechanism through ablation experiments. In addition, a series of generalizability experiments are conducted, with results showing that the proposed method yields improvements on various domain-specific datasets and advanced models in areas such as Finance, Wikidata, and StrategyQA. This demonstrates that the method is adaptable to multiple domains and provides a valuable approach for model training in future applications across diverse fields.",

However, with limited fine-tuning, PLMs still struggle with the discrepancies between the representation obtained from the PLMs' encoder and the optimal input to the PLMs' decoder. This paper tackles this challenge by learning to calibrate the representation of PLMs in the latent space. In the proposed representation calibration method (RepCali), we integrate a specific calibration block to the latent space after the encoder and use the calibrated output as the decoder input. The merits of the proposed RepCali include its universality to all PLMs with encoder-decoder architectures, its plug-and-play nature, and ease of implementation. Extensive experiments on 25 PLM-based models across 8 tasks (including both English and Chinese datasets) demonstrate that the proposed RepCali offers desirable enhancements to PLMs (including LLMs) and significantly improves the performance of downstream tasks. Comparison experiments across 4 benchmark tasks indicate that RepCali is superior to the representative fine-tuning baselines.",

Motivated by the notion that non-overlapping speech promotes clearer emotional coordination, while overlapping speech disrupts synchrony, this study examines how these conversational dynamics shape the spatial and temporal alignment of arousal and valence across facial and vocal modalities. Using dyadic interactions from the IEMOCAP dataset, we extracted continuous emotion estimates via EmoNet (facial video) and a Wav2Vec2-based model (speech audio). Segments were categorized based on speech overlap, and emotional alignment was assessed using Pearson correlation, lag adjusted analysis, and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). Across analyses, non overlapping speech was associated with more stable and predictable emotional synchrony than overlapping speech. While zero-lag correlations were low and not statistically different, non overlapping speech showed reduced variability, especially for arousal. Lag adjusted correlations and best-lag distributions revealed clearer, more consistent temporal alignment in these segments. In contrast, overlapping speech exhibited higher variability and flatter lag profiles, though DTW indicated unexpectedly tighter alignment suggesting distinct coordination strategies. Notably, directionality patterns showed that facial expressions more often preceded speech during turn-taking, while speech led during simultaneous vocalizations. These findings underscore the importance of conversational structure in regulating emotional communication and provide new insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of multimodal affective alignment in real world interaction.",

Their flexibility and covertness pose severe challenges to existing detection strategies. To bridge this gap, we introduce DigiFakeAV, the new large-scale multimodal digital human forgery dataset based on diffusion models.

To address this problem, we propose DigiShield, an effective detection baseline based on spatiotemporal and cross-modal fusion. By jointly modeling the 3D spatiotemporal features of videos and the semantic-acoustic features of audio, DigiShield achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the DigiFakeAV and shows strong generalization on other datasets.",

Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation. Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs' capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain, spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000 research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets: Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114 disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in their scientific exploration capabilities.

The recent research endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation. Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.",

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.18377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: DONNs leverage light propagation for efficient analog AI and signal processing. Advances in nanophotonic fabrication and metasurface-based wavefront engineering have opened new pathways to realize high-capacity DONNs across various spectral regimes. Training such DONN systems to determine the metasurface structures remains challenging. Heuristic methods are fast but oversimplify metasurfaces modulation, often resulting in physically unrealizable designs and significant performance degradation. Simulation-in-the-loop optimizes implementable metasurfaces via adjoint methods, but is computationally prohibitive and unscalable. To address these limitations, we propose SP2RINT, a spatially decoupled, progressive training framework that formulates DONN training as a PDE-constrained learning problem. Metasurface responses are first relaxed into freely trainable transfer matrices with a banded structure. We then progressively enforce physical constraints by alternating between transfer matrix training and adjoint-based inverse design, avoiding per-iteration PDE solves while ensuring final physical realizability. To further reduce runtime, we introduce a physics-inspired, spatially decoupled inverse design strategy based on the natural locality of field interactions. This approach partitions the metasurface into independently solvable patches, enabling scalable and parallel inverse design with system-level calibration. Evaluated across diverse DONN training tasks, SP2RINT achieves digital-comparable accuracy while being 1825 times faster than simulation-in-the-loop approaches. By bridging the gap between abstract DONN models and implementable photonic hardware, SP2RINT enables scalable, high-performance training of physically realizable meta-optical neural systems.

The ISLES'24 challenge addresses this need by providing longitudinal stroke imaging data, including CT scans taken on arrival to the hospital and follow-up MRI taken 2-9 days from initial arrival, with annotations derived from follow-up MRI. Importantly, models submitted to the ISLES'24 challenge are evaluated using only CT inputs, requiring prediction of lesion progression that may not be visible in CT scans for segmentation. Our winning solution shows that a carefully designed preprocessing pipeline including deep-learning-based skull stripping and custom intensity windowing is beneficial for accurate segmentation.

AI capability evaluations can capture detail about first-order effects, such as whether immediate system outputs are accurate, or contain toxic, biased or stereotypical content, but AI's second-order effects, i.e. any long-term outcomes and consequences that may result from AI use in the real world, have become a significant area of interest as the technology becomes embedded in our daily lives. These secondary effects can include shifts in user behavior, societal, cultural and economic ramifications, workforce transformations, and long-term downstream impacts that may result from a broad and growing set of risks. This position paper argues that measuring the indirect and secondary effects of AI will require expansion beyond static, single-turn approaches conducted in silico to include testing paradigms that can capture what actually materializes when people use AI technology in context.

However, ERL suffers from the high computational costs and low search efficiency, as EAs require evaluating numerous candidate policies with expensive simulations, many of which are ineffective and do not contribute meaningfully to the training. One intuitive way to reduce the ineffective evaluations is to adopt the surrogates. Unfortunately, existing ERL policies are often modeled as deep neural networks (DNNs) and thus naturally represented as high-dimensional vectors containing millions of weights, which makes the building of effective surrogates for ERL policies extremely challenging. This paper proposes a novel surrogate-assisted ERL that integrates Autoencoders (AE) and Hyperbolic Neural Networks (HNN). Specifically, AE compresses high-dimensional policies into low-dimensional representations while extracting key features as the inputs for the surrogate. HNN, functioning as a classification-based surrogate model, can learn complex nonlinear relationships from sampled data and enable more accurate pre-selection of the sampled policies without real evaluations. The experiments on 10 Atari and 4 Mujoco games have verified that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches significantly. The search trajectories guided by AE and HNN are also visually demonstrated to be more effective, in terms of both exploration and convergence. This paper not only presents the first learnable policy embedding and surrogate-modeling modules for high-dimensional ERL policies, but also empirically reveals when and why they can be successful.",

Most existing methods typically introduce KL divergence to constrain deviations between the trained model and the reference model; however, this may not be sufficient in certain applications that require tight risk control. In this paper, we introduce Risk-aware Direct Preference Optimization (Ra-DPO), a novel approach that incorporates risk-awareness by employing a class of nested risk measures. This approach formulates a constrained risk-aware advantage function maximization problem and then converts the Bradley-Terry model into a token-level representation. The objective function maximizes the likelihood of the policy while suppressing the deviation between a trained model and the reference model using a sequential risk ratio, thereby enhancing the model's risk-awareness.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.20579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Sometimes we benefit from actions that others have taken even when we are unaware that they took those actions. For example, if your neighbor chooses not to take a parking spot in front of your house when you are not there, you can benefit, even without being aware that they took this action. These \"hidden gifts\" represent an interesting challenge for multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), since assigning credit when the beneficial actions of others are hidden is non-trivial. Here, we study the impact of hidden gifts with a very simple MARL task. In this task, agents in a grid-world environment have individual doors to unlock in order to obtain individual rewards. As well, if all the agents unlock their door the group receives a larger collective reward. However, there is only one key for all of the doors, such that the collective reward can only be obtained when the agents drop the key for others after they use it. Notably, there is nothing to indicate to an agent that the other agents have dropped the key, thus the act of dropping the key for others is a \"hidden gift\". We show that several different state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including MARL algorithms, fail to learn how to obtain the collective reward in this simple task. Interestingly, we find that independent model-free policy gradient agents can solve the task when we provide them with information about their own action history, but MARL agents still cannot solve the task with action history. Finally, we derive a correction term for these independent agents, inspired by learning aware approaches, which reduces the variance in learning and helps them to converge to collective success more reliably. These results show that credit assignment in multi-agent settings can be particularly challenging in the presence of \"hidden gifts\", and demonstrate that learning awareness in independent agents can benefit these settings.",

As NLP tasks become more complex and modularized, selecting the suitable LLM tier for each subtask is a key challenge to balance between cost and performance. To address the problem, we introduce LLM Automatic Transmission (LLM-AT) framework that automatically selects LLM tiers without training. LLM-AT consists of Starter, Generator, and Judge. The starter selects the initial LLM tier expected to solve the given question, the generator produces a response using the LLM of the selected tier, and the judge evaluates the validity of the response. If the response is invalid, LLM-AT iteratively upgrades to a higher-tier model, generates a new response, and re-evaluates until a valid response is obtained. Additionally, we propose accuracy estimator, which enables the suitable initial LLM tier selection without training. Given an input question, accuracy estimator estimates the expected accuracy of each LLM tier by computing the valid response rate across top-k similar queries from past inference records. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-AT achieves superior performance while reducing costs, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.",

To investigate this, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art bias mitigation methods across multiple vision and language classification tasks, systematically varying subgroup definitions, including coarse, fine-grained, intersectional, and noisy subgroups. Our results reveal that subgroup choice significantly impacts performance, with certain groupings paradoxically leading to worse outcomes than no mitigation at all. Our findings suggest that observing a disparity between a set of subgroups is not a sufficient reason to use those subgroups for mitigation. Through theoretical analysis, we explain these phenomena and uncover a counter-intuitive insight that, in some cases, improving fairness with respect to a particular set of subgroups is best achieved by using a different set of subgroups for mitigation. Our work highlights the importance of careful subgroup definition in bias mitigation and presents it as an alternative lever for improving the robustness and fairness of machine learning models.",

However, users can only passively receive social predictions without being able to choose the underlying algorithm, which limits personalization. Fortunately, with the emergence of blockchain, users are allowed to choose algorithms that are tailored to their local situation, improving prediction results in a personalized way. In a blockchain environment, each user possesses its own model to perform the social prediction, capturing different perspectives on social interactions. In our work, we propose DeSocial, a decentralized social network learning framework deployed on an Ethereum (ETH) local development chain that integrates distributed data storage, node-level consensus, and user-driven model selection through Ganache. In the first stage, each user leverages DeSocial to evaluate multiple backbone models on their local subgraph. DeSocial coordinates the execution and returns model-wise prediction results, enabling the user to select the most suitable backbone for personalized social prediction. Then, DeSocial uniformly selects several validation nodes that possess the algorithm specified by each user, and aggregates the prediction results by majority voting, to prevent errors caused by any single model's misjudgment. Extensive experiments show that DeSocial has an evident improvement compared to the five classical centralized social network learning models, promoting user empowerment in blockchain-based decentralized social networks, showing the importance of multi-node validation and personalized algorithm selection based on blockchain.

However, the potential of slow thinking remains largely unexplored for robotic foundation models interacting with the physical world. In this work, we propose Hume: a dual-system Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with value-guided System-2 thinking and cascaded action denoising, exploring human-like thinking capabilities of Vision-Language-Action models for dexterous robot control. System 2 of Hume implements value-Guided thinking by extending a Vision-Language-Action Model backbone with a novel value-query head to estimate the state-action value of predicted actions. The value-guided thinking is conducted by repeat sampling multiple action candidates and selecting one according to state-action value. System 1 of Hume is a lightweight reactive visuomotor policy that takes System 2 selected action and performs cascaded action denoising for dexterous robot control. At deployment time, System 2 performs value-guided thinking at a low frequency while System 1 asynchronously receives the System 2 selected action candidate and predicts fluid actions in real time. We show that Hume outperforms the existing state-of-the-art Vision-Language-Action models across multiple simulation benchmark and real-robot deployments.",

While existing systems such as Whisper, USM, and MMS achieve promising performance, their efficacy remains inadequate in terms of training costs, latency, and accessibility. To address these issues, we propose VietASR, a novel ASR training pipeline that leverages vast amounts of unlabeled data and a small set of labeled data. Through multi-iteration ASR-biased self-supervised learning on a large-scale unlabeled dataset, VietASR offers a cost-effective and practical solution for enhancing ASR performance. Experiments demonstrate that pre-training on 70,000-hour unlabeled data and fine-tuning on merely 50-hour labeled data yield a lightweight but powerful ASR model. It outperforms Whisper Large-v3 and commercial ASR systems on real-world data. Our code and models will be open-sourced to facilitate research in low-resource ASR.",

Hinted by the observed redundancy of attention at inference time, we hypothesize that though the model learns complicated token dependency through pretraining, the inference-time sequence-to-sequence mapping in each attention layer is actually ''simple'' enough to be represented with a much cheaper function. In this work, we explore FAR, a Function-preserving Attention Replacement framework that replaces all attention blocks in pretrained transformers with learnable sequence-to-sequence modules, exemplified by an LSTM. FAR optimize a multi-head LSTM architecture with a block-wise distillation objective and a global structural pruning framework to achieve a family of efficient LSTM-based models from pretrained transformers. We validate FAR on the DeiT vision transformer family and demonstrate that it matches the accuracy of the original models on ImageNet and multiple downstream tasks with reduced parameters and latency. Further analysis shows that FAR preserves the semantic token relationships and the token-to-token correlation learned in the transformer's attention module.",

We introduce CAST, a semi-supervised knowledge distillation (SSKD) framework that compresses pretrained vision foundation models (VFM) into compact experts using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. CAST unfolds in three stages: (1) domain adaptation of the VFM teacher(s) via self-training with contrastive pixel calibration, (2) distillation into a compact student via a unified multi-objective loss that couples standard supervision and pseudo-labels with our instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive term, and (3) fine-tuning on labeled data to remove residual pseudo-label bias. Central to CAST is an \\emph{instance-aware pixel-wise contrastive loss} that fuses mask and class scores to mine informative negatives and enforce clear inter-instance margins. By maintaining this contrastive signal across both adaptation and distillation, we align teacher and student embeddings and fully leverage unlabeled images. On Cityscapes and ADE20K, our ~11X smaller student surpasses its adapted VFM teacher(s) by +3.4 AP (33.9 vs. 30.5) and +1.5 AP (16.7 vs. 15.2) and outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches.",

We propose Cross-modal RAG, a novel framework that decomposes both queries and images into sub-dimensional components, enabling subquery-aware retrieval and generation. Our method introduces a hybrid retrieval strategy - combining a sub-dimensional sparse retriever with a dense retriever - to identify a Pareto-optimal set of images, each contributing complementary aspects of the query. During generation, a multimodal large language model is guided to selectively condition on relevant visual features aligned to specific subqueries, ensuring subquery-aware image synthesis.

We propose DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making.

    "summary": "arXiv:2505.22179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross \nAbstract: Speculative decoding and quantization effectively accelerate memory-bound inference of large language models. Speculative decoding mitigates the memory bandwidth bottleneck by verifying multiple tokens within a single forward pass, which increases computational effort. Quantization achieves this optimization by compressing weights and activations into lower bit-widths and also reduces computations via low-bit matrix multiplications. To further leverage their strengths, we investigate the integration of these two techniques. Surprisingly, experiments applying the advanced speculative decoding method EAGLE-2 to various quantized models reveal that the memory benefits from 4-bit weight quantization are diminished by the computational load from speculative decoding. Specifically, verifying a tree-style draft incurs significantly more time overhead than a single-token forward pass on 4-bit weight quantized models. This finding led to our new speculative decoding design: a hierarchical framework that employs a small model as an intermediate stage to turn tree-style drafts into sequence drafts, leveraging the memory access benefits of the target quantized model. Experimental results show that our hierarchical approach achieves a 2.78$\\times$ speedup across various tasks for the 4-bit weight Llama-3-70B model on an A100 GPU, outperforming EAGLE-2 by 1.31$\\times$.

Gradient projection has emerged as an effective and popular paradigm in CL, where it partitions the gradient space of previously learned tasks into two orthogonal subspaces: a primary subspace and a minor subspace. New tasks are learned effectively within the minor subspace, thereby reducing interference with previously acquired knowledge. However, existing Gradient Projection methods struggle to achieve an optimal balance between plasticity and stability, as it is hard to appropriately partition the gradient space. In this work, we consider a continual learning paradigm based on Low-Rank Adaptation, which has gained considerable attention due to its efficiency and wide applicability, and propose a novel approach for continual learning, called SplitLoRA. We first provide a theoretical analysis of how subspace partitioning affects model stability and plasticity. Informed by this analysis, we then introduce an effective method that derives the optimal partition of the gradient space for previously learned tasks. This approach effectively balances stability and plasticity in continual learning.

However, existing CL methods only rely on the parameters of the most recent task for inference, which makes them susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. Inspired by the recent success of model merging techniques, we propose \\textbf{Perturb-and-Merge (P\\&M)}, a novel continual learning framework that integrates model merging into the CL paradigm to mitigate forgetting. Specifically, after training on each task, P\\&M constructs a new model by forming a convex combination of the previous model and the newly trained task-specific model. Through theoretical analysis, we minimize the total loss increase across all tasks and derive an analytical solution for the optimal merging coefficient. To further improve the performance of the merged model, we observe that the degradation introduced during merging can be alleviated by a regularization term composed of the task vector and the Hessian matrix of the loss function. Interestingly, we show that this term can be efficiently approximated using second-order symmetric finite differences, and a stochastic perturbation strategy along the task vector direction is accordingly devised which incurs no additional forward or backward passes while providing an effective approximation of the regularization term. Finally, we combine P\\&M with LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, to reduce memory overhead.

Nonetheless, previous works mainly focus on solving RAG systems with either single-hop or multi-hop approaches separately, which limits the application of those approaches to real-world applications. In this study, we propose a trainable agent framework called Agent-UniRAG for unified retrieval-augmented LLM systems, which enhances the effectiveness and interpretability of RAG systems. The main idea is to design an LLM agent framework to solve RAG tasks step-by-step based on the complexity of the inputs, simultaneously including single-hop and multi-hop queries in an end-to-end manner. Furthermore, we introduce SynAgent-RAG, a synthetic dataset to enable the proposed agent framework for small open-source LLMs (e.g., Llama-3-8B).

This recommendation unlearning challenge presents unique difficulties as removing connections within interaction graphs creates ripple effects throughout the model, potentially impacting recommendations for numerous users. Traditional approaches suffer from significant drawbacks: fragmentation methods damage graph structure and diminish performance, while influence function techniques make assumptions that may not hold in complex GNNs, particularly with self-supervised or random architectures. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-agnostic pre-training paradigm UnlearnRec that prepares systems for efficient unlearning operations. Our Influence Encoder takes unlearning requests together with existing model parameters and directly produces updated parameters of unlearned model with little fine-tuning, avoiding complete retraining while preserving model performance characteristics.

    "summary": "Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of differential information.",

    "summary": "Rebus puzzles, visual riddles that encode language through imagery, spatial arrangement, and symbolic substitution, pose a unique challenge to current vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional image captioning or question answering tasks, rebus solving requires multi-modal abstraction, symbolic reasoning, and a grasp of cultural, phonetic and linguistic puns. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of contemporary VLMs to interpret and solve rebus puzzles by constructing a hand-generated and annotated benchmark of diverse English-language rebus puzzles, ranging from simple pictographic substitutions to spatially-dependent cues (\"head\" over \"heels\"). We analyze how different VLMs perform, and our findings reveal that while VLMs exhibit some surprising capabilities in decoding simple visual clues, they struggle significantly with tasks requiring abstract reasoning, lateral thinking, and understanding visual metaphors.",

LoRAShop builds on a key observation about the feature interaction patterns inside Flux-style diffusion transformers: concept-specific transformer features activate spatially coherent regions early in the denoising process. We harness this observation to derive a disentangled latent mask for each concept in a prior forward pass and blend the corresponding LoRA weights only within regions bounding the concepts to be personalized. The resulting edits seamlessly integrate multiple subjects or styles into the original scene while preserving global context, lighting, and fine details. Our experiments demonstrate that LoRAShop delivers better identity preservation compared to baselines.

In this work, we propose DeepTheorem, a comprehensive informal theorem-proving framework exploiting natural language to enhance LLM mathematical reasoning. DeepTheorem includes a large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of 121K high-quality IMO-level informal theorems and proofs spanning diverse mathematical domains, rigorously annotated for correctness, difficulty, and topic categories, accompanied by systematically constructed verifiable theorem variants. We devise a novel reinforcement learning strategy (RL-Zero) explicitly tailored to informal theorem proving, leveraging the verified theorem variants to incentivize robust mathematical inference.

    "summary": "Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space. REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to 3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly enhanced performance on 2D visual tasks. However, improving their spatial intelligence remains a challenge. Existing 3D MLLMs always rely on additional 3D or 2.5D data to incorporate spatial awareness, restricting their utility in scenarios with only 2D inputs, such as images or videos. In this paper, we present Spatial-MLLM, a novel framework for visual-based spatial reasoning from purely 2D observations. Unlike conventional video MLLMs which rely on CLIP-based visual encoders optimized for semantic understanding, our key insight is to unleash the strong structure prior from the feed-forward visual geometry foundation model. Specifically, we propose a dual-encoder architecture: a pretrained 2D visual encoder to extract semantic features, and a spatial encoder-initialized from the backbone of the visual geometry model-to extract 3D structure features. A connector then integrates both features into unified visual tokens for enhanced spatial understanding. Furthermore, we propose a space-aware frame sampling strategy at inference time, which selects the spatially informative frames of a video sequence, ensuring that even under limited token length, the model focuses on frames critical for spatial reasoning. Beyond architecture improvements, we construct the Spatial-MLLM-120k dataset and train the model on it using supervised fine-tuning and GRPO. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our spatial-MLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of visual-based spatial understanding and reasoning tasks.

While they excel in zero-shot and transfer learning scenarios, VLMs remain susceptible to misclassification, often yielding confident yet incorrect predictions. This limitation poses a significant risk in safety-critical domains, where erroneous predictions can lead to severe consequences. In this work, we introduce TrustVLM, a training-free framework designed to address the critical challenge of estimating when VLM's predictions can be trusted. Motivated by the observed modality gap in VLMs and the insight that certain concepts are more distinctly represented in the image embedding space, we propose a novel confidence-scoring function that leverages this space to improve misclassification detection. We rigorously evaluate our approach across 17 diverse datasets, employing 4 architectures and 2 VLMs, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 51.87% in AURC, 9.14% in AUROC, and 32.42% in FPR95 compared to existing baselines.

However, video generation based on multiple reference subjects still faces significant challenges in maintaining multi-subject consistency and ensuring high generation quality. In this paper, we propose MAGREF, a unified framework for any-reference video generation that introduces masked guidance to enable coherent multi-subject video synthesis conditioned on diverse reference images and a textual prompt. Specifically, we propose (1) a region-aware dynamic masking mechanism that enables a single model to flexibly handle various subject inference, including humans, objects, and backgrounds, without architectural changes, and (2) a pixel-wise channel concatenation mechanism that operates on the channel dimension to better preserve appearance features. Our model delivers state-of-the-art video generation quality, generalizing from single-subject training to complex multi-subject scenarios with coherent synthesis and precise control over individual subjects, outperforming existing open-source and commercial baselines.

    "summary": "Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity, however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e., optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models. Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context performance of Titans, achieving +80\\% accuracy in 10M context length of BABILong benchmark.",

However, their scalability is fundamentally constrained by the limited capacity of their encoders, leading to degraded performance or excessive memory consumption as the number of input views increases. In this work, we analyze feed-forward 3DGS frameworks through the lens of the Information Bottleneck principle and introduce ZPressor, a lightweight architecture-agnostic module that enables efficient compression of multi-view inputs into a compact latent state Z that retains essential scene information while discarding redundancy. Concretely, ZPressor enables existing feed-forward 3DGS models to scale to over 100 input views at 480P resolution on an 80GB GPU, by partitioning the views into anchor and support sets and using cross attention to compress the information from the support views into anchor views, forming the compressed latent state Z. We show that integrating ZPressor into several state-of-the-art feed-forward 3DGS models consistently improves performance under moderate input views and enhances robustness under dense view settings on two large-scale benchmarks DL3DV-10K and RealEstate10K.

This unified design scales effortlessly to casually captured, multi view datasets without any pose annotations.

To address this, we propose a new benchmark, VF-Eval, which introduces four tasks-coherence validation, error awareness, error type detection, and reasoning evaluation-to comprehensively evaluate the abilities of MLLMs on AIGC videos. We evaluate 13 frontier MLLMs on VF-Eval and find that even the best-performing model, GPT-4.1, struggles to achieve consistently good performance across all tasks. This highlights the challenging nature of our benchmark.

    "title": "Grounded Reinforcement Learning for Visual Reasoning",
    "summary": "While reinforcement learning (RL) over chains of thought has significantly advanced language models in tasks such as mathematics and coding, visual reasoning introduces added complexity by requiring models to direct visual attention, interpret perceptual inputs, and ground abstract reasoning in spatial evidence. We introduce ViGoRL (Visually Grounded Reinforcement Learning), a vision-language model trained with RL to explicitly anchor each reasoning step to specific visual coordinates. Inspired by human visual decision-making, ViGoRL learns to produce spatially grounded reasoning traces, guiding visual attention to task-relevant regions at each step. When fine-grained exploration is required, our novel multi-turn RL framework enables the model to dynamically zoom into predicted coordinates as reasoning unfolds. Across a diverse set of visual reasoning benchmarks--including SAT-2 and BLINK for spatial reasoning, V*bench for visual search, and ScreenSpot and VisualWebArena for web-based grounding--ViGoRL consistently outperforms both supervised fine-tuning and conventional RL baselines that lack explicit grounding mechanisms. Incorporating multi-turn RL with zoomed-in visual feedback significantly improves ViGoRL's performance on localizing small GUI elements and visual search, achieving 86.4% on V*Bench. Additionally, we find that grounding amplifies other visual behaviors such as region exploration, grounded subgoal setting, and visual verification. Finally, human evaluations show that the model's visual references are not only spatially accurate but also helpful for understanding model reasoning steps. Our results show that visually grounded RL is a strong paradigm for imbuing models with general-purpose visual reasoning.",

    "summary": "This paper presents Diffusion via Autoregressive models (D-AR), a new paradigm recasting the image diffusion process as a vanilla autoregressive procedure in the standard next-token-prediction fashion. We start by designing the tokenizer that converts images into sequences of discrete tokens, where tokens in different positions can be decoded into different diffusion denoising steps in the pixel space. Thanks to the diffusion properties, these tokens naturally follow a coarse-to-fine order, which directly lends itself to autoregressive modeling. Therefore, we apply standard next-token prediction on these tokens, without modifying any underlying designs (either causal masks or training/inference strategies), and such sequential autoregressive token generation directly mirrors the diffusion procedure in image space. That is, once the autoregressive model generates an increment of tokens, we can directly decode these tokens into the corresponding diffusion denoising step in the streaming manner. Our pipeline naturally reveals several intriguing properties, for example, it supports consistent previews when generating only a subset of tokens and enables zero-shot layout-controlled synthesis. On the standard ImageNet benchmark, our method achieves 2.09 FID using a 775M Llama backbone with 256 discrete tokens.

    "title": "Are Reasoning Models More Prone to Hallucination?",
    "summary": "Recently evolved large reasoning models (LRMs) show powerful performance in solving complex tasks with long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capability. As these LRMs are mostly developed by post-training on formal reasoning tasks, whether they generalize the reasoning capability to help reduce hallucination in fact-seeking tasks remains unclear and debated. For instance, DeepSeek-R1 reports increased performance on SimpleQA, a fact-seeking benchmark, while OpenAI-o3 observes even severer hallucination. This discrepancy naturally raises the following research question: Are reasoning models more prone to hallucination? This paper addresses the question from three perspectives. (1) We first conduct a holistic evaluation for the hallucination in LRMs. Our analysis reveals that LRMs undergo a full post-training pipeline with cold start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and verifiable reward RL generally alleviate their hallucination. In contrast, both distillation alone and RL training without cold start fine-tuning introduce more nuanced hallucinations. (2) To explore why different post-training pipelines alters the impact on hallucination in LRMs, we conduct behavior analysis. We characterize two critical cognitive behaviors that directly affect the factuality of a LRM: Flaw Repetition, where the surface-level reasoning attempts repeatedly follow the same underlying flawed logic, and Think-Answer Mismatch, where the final answer fails to faithfully match the previous CoT process. (3) Further, we investigate the mechanism behind the hallucination of LRMs from the perspective of model uncertainty. We find that increased hallucination of LRMs is usually associated with the misalignment between model uncertainty and factual accuracy. Our work provides an initial understanding of the hallucination in LRMs.",

Current supervised deep learning approaches, while powerful, are limited by the need for extensive, task-specific labeled data and struggle to generalize to the immense variability and open-set nature of real-world acoustic scenes. Inspired by the success of generative foundation models, we investigate whether pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion models can overcome these limitations. We make a surprising discovery: zero-shot source separation can be achieved purely through a pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion model under the right configuration. Our method, named ZeroSep, works by inverting the mixed audio into the diffusion model's latent space and then using text conditioning to guide the denoising process to recover individual sources. Without any task-specific training or fine-tuning, ZeroSep repurposes the generative diffusion model for a discriminative separation task and inherently supports open-set scenarios through its rich textual priors. ZeroSep is compatible with a variety of pre-trained text-guided audio diffusion backbones and delivers strong separation performance on multiple separation benchmarks, surpassing even supervised methods.",

Autoregressive unified models suffer from slow inference due to sequential decoding, and non-autoregressive unified models suffer from weak generalization due to limited pretrained backbones. We introduce Muddit, a unified discrete diffusion transformer that enables fast and parallel generation across both text and image modalities. Unlike prior unified diffusion models trained from scratch, Muddit integrates strong visual priors from a pretrained text-to-image backbone with a lightweight text decoder, enabling flexible and high-quality multimodal generation under a unified architecture. Empirical results show that Muddit achieves competitive or superior performance compared to significantly larger autoregressive models in both quality and efficiency. The work highlights the potential of purely discrete diffusion, when equipped with strong visual priors, as a scalable and effective backbone for unified generation.",

    "title": "Satori-SWE: Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling for Sample-Efficient Software Engineering",
    "summary": "Language models (LMs) perform well on standardized coding benchmarks but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks such as resolving GitHub issues in SWE-Bench, especially when model parameters are less than 100B. While smaller models are preferable in practice due to their lower computational cost, improving their performance remains challenging. Existing approaches primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with high-quality data, which is expensive to curate at scale. An alternative is test-time scaling: generating multiple outputs, scoring them using a verifier, and selecting the best one. Although effective, this strategy often requires excessive sampling and costly scoring, limiting its practical application. We propose Evolutionary Test-Time Scaling (EvoScale), a sample-efficient method that treats generation as an evolutionary process. By iteratively refining outputs via selection and mutation, EvoScale shifts the output distribution toward higher-scoring regions, reducing the number of samples needed to find correct solutions. To reduce the overhead from repeatedly sampling and selection, we train the model to self-evolve using reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than relying on external verifiers at inference time, the model learns to self-improve the scores of its own generations across iterations. Evaluated on SWE-Bench-Verified, EvoScale enables our 32B model, Satori-SWE-32B, to match or exceed the performance of models with over 100B parameters while using a few samples. Code, data, and models will be fully open-sourced.",

In this work, we propose On-Policy RL with Optimal reward baseline (OPO), a novel and simplified reinforcement learning algorithm designed to address these challenges. OPO emphasizes the importance of exact on-policy training, which empirically stabilizes the training process and enhances exploration. Moreover, OPO introduces the optimal reward baseline that theoretically minimizes gradient variance. We evaluate OPO on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The results demonstrate its superior performance and training stability without additional models or regularization terms. Furthermore, OPO achieves lower policy shifts and higher output entropy, encouraging more diverse and less repetitive responses.

While SWE-bench and its variants have become standard in this domain, they suffer from key limitations: they have not been updated since their initial releases, cover a narrow set of repositories, and depend heavily on manual effort for instance construction and environment setup. These factors hinder scalability and introduce risks of overfitting and data contamination. In this work, we present SWE-bench-Live, a live-updatable benchmark designed to overcome these challenges. Our initial release consists of 1,319 tasks derived from real GitHub issues created since 2024, spanning 93 repositories. Each task is accompanied by a dedicated Docker image to ensure reproducible execution. Central to our benchmark is \\method, an automated curation pipeline that streamlines the entire process from instance creation to environment setup, removing manual bottlenecks and enabling scalability and continuous updates. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agent frameworks and LLMs on SWE-bench-Live, revealing a substantial performance gap compared to static benchmarks like SWE-bench, even under controlled evaluation conditions. To better understand this discrepancy, we perform detailed analyses across repository origin, issue recency, and task difficulty. By providing a fresh, diverse, and executable benchmark grounded in live repository activity, SWE-bench-Live facilitates rigorous, contamination-resistant evaluation of LLMs and agents in dynamic, real-world software development settings.",

Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that KVzip reduces KV cache size by 3-4times and FlashAttention decoding latency by approximately 2times, with negligible performance loss in question-answering, retrieval, reasoning, and code comprehension tasks. Evaluations include various models such as LLaMA3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-14B, and Gemma3-12B, with context lengths reaching up to 170K tokens.

However, these models typically rely on large-scale datasets and require substantial computation during the pretraining stage. In addition, several post-training methods have been proposed, but they often depend on external data or are limited to task-specific customization. In this work, we introduce UniRL, a self-improving post-training approach. Our approach enables the model to generate images from prompts and use them as training data in each iteration, without relying on any external image data. Moreover, it enables the two tasks to enhance each other: the generated images are used for understanding, and the understanding results are used to supervise generation. We explore supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize the models. UniRL offers three key advantages: (1) it requires no external image data, as all training samples are generated by the model itself during training; (2) it not only improves individual task performance, but also reduces the imbalance between generation and understanding; and (3) it requires only several additional training steps during the post-training stage. We evaluate UniRL on top of Show-o and Janus, achieving a GenEval score of 0.77 for Show-o and 0.65 for Janus. Code and models will be released in https://github.com/showlab/UniRL.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have shown that long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on complex tasks. However, this benefit is yet to be demonstrated in the domain of video understanding, since most existing benchmarks lack the reasoning depth required to demonstrate the advantages of extended CoT chains. While recent efforts have proposed benchmarks aimed at video reasoning, the tasks are often knowledge-driven and do not rely heavily on visual content. To bridge this gap, we introduce VideoReasonBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate vision-centric, complex video reasoning. To ensure visual richness and high reasoning complexity, each video in VideoReasonBench depicts a sequence of fine-grained operations on a latent state that is only visible in part of the video. The questions evaluate three escalating levels of video reasoning skills: recalling observed visual information, inferring the content of latent states, and predicting information beyond the video. Under such task setting, models have to precisely recall multiple operations in the video, and perform step-by-step reasoning to get correct final answers for these questions. Using VideoReasonBench, we comprehensively evaluate 18 state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), finding that most perform poorly on complex video reasoning, e.g., GPT-4o achieves only 6.9% accuracy, while the thinking-enhanced Gemini-2.5-Pro significantly outperforms others with 56.0% accuracy. Our investigations on \"test-time scaling\" further reveal that extended thinking budget, while offering none or minimal benefits on existing video benchmarks, is essential for improving the performance on VideoReasonBench.",

Existing approaches predominantly rely on UV-based inpainting to refine textures after reprojecting the generated multi-view images onto the 3D shapes, which introduces challenges related to topological ambiguity. To address this, we propose to bypass the limitations of UV mapping by operating directly in a unified 3D functional space. Specifically, we first propose that lifts texture generation into 3D space via Texture Functions (TFs)--a continuous, volumetric representation that maps any 3D point to a texture value based solely on surface proximity, independent of mesh topology. Then, we propose to predict these TFs directly from images and geometry inputs using a transformer-based Large Texturing Model (LTM). To further enhance texture quality and leverage powerful 2D priors, we develop an advanced LoRA-based strategy for efficiently adapting large-scale Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for high-quality multi-view texture synthesis as our first stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniTEX achieves superior visual quality and texture integrity compared to existing approaches, offering a generalizable and scalable solution for automated 3D texture generation.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising potential in persuasion, but existing works on training LLM persuaders are still preliminary. Notably, while humans are skilled in modeling their opponent's thoughts and opinions proactively and dynamically, current LLMs struggle with such Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning, resulting in limited diversity and opponent awareness. To address this limitation, we introduce Theory of Mind Augmented Persuader (ToMAP), a novel approach for building more flexible persuader agents by incorporating two theory of mind modules that enhance the persuader's awareness and analysis of the opponent's mental state. Specifically, we begin by prompting the persuader to consider possible objections to the target central claim, and then use a text encoder paired with a trained MLP classifier to predict the opponent's current stance on these counterclaims. Our carefully designed reinforcement learning schema enables the persuader learns how to analyze opponent-related information and utilize it to generate more effective arguments. Experiments show that the ToMAP persuader, while containing only 3B parameters, outperforms much larger baselines, like GPT-4o, with a relative gain of 39.4% across multiple persuadee models and diverse corpora. Notably, ToMAP exhibits complex reasoning chains and reduced repetition during training, which leads to more diverse and effective arguments. The opponent-aware feature of ToMAP also makes it suitable for long conversations and enables it to employ more logical and opponent-aware strategies.

A huge bottleneck is the attention mechanism where complexity scales quadratically with resolution and video length. One logical way to lessen this burden is sparse attention, where only a subset of tokens or patches are included in the calculation. However, existing techniques fail to preserve visual quality at extremely high sparsity levels and might even incur non-negligible compute overheads. % To address this concern, we propose Re-ttention, which implements very high sparse attention for visual generation models by leveraging the temporal redundancy of Diffusion Models to overcome the probabilistic normalization shift within the attention mechanism. Specifically, Re-ttention reshapes attention scores based on the prior softmax distribution history in order to preserve the visual quality of the full quadratic attention at very high sparsity levels. % Experimental results on T2V/T2I models such as CogVideoX and the PixArt DiTs demonstrate that Re-ttention requires as few as 3.1\\% of the tokens during inference, outperforming contemporary methods like FastDiTAttn, Sparse VideoGen and MInference.

We comprehensively evaluate two leading families of LRMs on our XReasoning benchmark and find that even the most advanced models often revert to English or produce fragmented reasoning in other languages, revealing a substantial gap in multilingual reasoning. Prompt based interventions that force models to reason in the users language improve readability and oversight but reduce answer accuracy, exposing an important trade off.

VidText offers the following key features: 1) It covers a wide range of real-world scenarios and supports multilingual content, encompassing diverse settings where video text naturally appears. 2) It introduces a hierarchical evaluation framework with video-level, clip-level, and instance-level tasks, enabling assessment of both global summarization and local retrieval capabilities. 3) The benchmark also introduces a set of paired perception reasoning tasks, ranging from visual text perception to cross-modal reasoning between textual and visual information. Extensive experiments on 18 state-of-the-art Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) reveal that current models struggle across most tasks, with significant room for improvement. Further analysis highlights the impact of both model-intrinsic factors, such as input resolution and OCR capability, and external factors, including the use of auxiliary information and Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies. We hope VidText will fill the current gap in video understanding benchmarks and serve as a foundation for future research on multimodal reasoning with video text in dynamic environments.",

    "title": "StressTest: Can YOUR Speech LM Handle the Stress?",
    "summary": "Sentence stress refers to emphasis, placed on specific words within a spoken utterance to highlight or contrast an idea, or to introduce new information. It is often used to imply an underlying intention that is not explicitly stated. Recent advances in speech-aware language models (SLMs) have enabled direct processing of audio, allowing models to bypass transcription and access the full richness of the speech signal and perform audio reasoning tasks such as spoken question answering. Despite the crucial role of sentence stress in shaping meaning and speaker intent, it remains largely overlooked in evaluation and development of such models. In this work, we address this gap by introducing StressTest, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate a model's ability to distinguish between interpretations of spoken sentences based on the stress pattern. We assess the performance of several leading SLMs and find that, despite their overall capabilities, they perform poorly on such tasks. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel synthetic data generation pipeline, and create Stress17k, a training set that simulates change of meaning implied by stress variation. Then, we empirically show that optimizing models with this synthetic dataset aligns well with real-world recordings and enables effective finetuning of SLMs. Results suggest, that our finetuned model, StresSLM, significantly outperforms existing models on both sentence stress reasoning and detection tasks.

    "summary": "Recent studies on post-training large language models (LLMs) for reasoning through reinforcement learning (RL) typically focus on tasks that can be accurately verified and rewarded, such as solving math problems. In contrast, our research investigates the impact of reward noise, a more practical consideration for real-world scenarios involving the post-training of LLMs using reward models. We found that LLMs demonstrate strong robustness to substantial reward noise. For example, manually flipping 40% of the reward function's outputs in math tasks still allows a Qwen-2.5-7B model to achieve rapid convergence, improving its performance on math tasks from 5% to 72%, compared to the 75% accuracy achieved by a model trained with noiseless rewards. Surprisingly, by only rewarding the appearance of key reasoning phrases (namely reasoning pattern reward, RPR), such as ``first, I need to''-without verifying the correctness of answers, the model achieved peak downstream performance (over 70% accuracy for Qwen-2.5-7B) comparable to models trained with strict correctness verification and accurate rewards. Recognizing the importance of the reasoning process over the final results, we combined RPR with noisy reward models. RPR helped calibrate the noisy reward models, mitigating potential false negatives and enhancing the LLM's performance on open-ended tasks. These findings suggest the importance of improving models' foundational abilities during the pre-training phase while providing insights for advancing post-training techniques.

However, the practical inference speed of open-sourced Diffusion LLMs often lags behind autoregressive models due to the lack of Key-Value (KV) Cache and quality degradation when decoding multiple tokens simultaneously. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel block-wise approximate KV Cache mechanism tailored for bidirectional diffusion models, enabling cache reuse with negligible performance drop. Additionally, we identify the root cause of generation quality degradation in parallel decoding as the disruption of token dependencies under the conditional independence assumption. To address this, we propose a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that selectively decodes tokens exceeding a confidence threshold, mitigating dependency violations and maintaining generation quality. Experimental results on LLaDA and Dream models across multiple LLM benchmarks demonstrate up to 27.6times throughput improvement with minimal accuracy loss, closing the performance gap with autoregressive models and paving the way for practical deployment of Diffusion LLMs.",

In autonomous driving, these capabilities help vehicles anticipate the behavior of other road users, perform risk-aware planning, accelerate training in simulation, and adapt to novel scenarios, thereby enhancing safety and reliability. Current approaches exhibit deficiencies in maintaining robust 3D geometric consistency or accumulating artifacts during occlusion handling, both critical for reliable safety assessment in autonomous navigation tasks. To address this, we introduce GeoDrive, which explicitly integrates robust 3D geometry conditions into driving world models to enhance spatial understanding and action controllability. Specifically, we first extract a 3D representation from the input frame and then obtain its 2D rendering based on the user-specified ego-car trajectory. To enable dynamic modeling, we propose a dynamic editing module during training to enhance the renderings by editing the positions of the vehicles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models in both action accuracy and 3D spatial awareness, leading to more realistic, adaptable, and reliable scene modeling for safer autonomous driving. Additionally, our model can generalize to novel trajectories and offers interactive scene editing capabilities, such as object editing and object trajectory control.",

Early diffusion models emphasized perceptual quality, while newer multimodal models like GPT-4o-image integrate high-level reasoning, improving semantic understanding and structural composition. Scientific illustration generation exemplifies this evolution: unlike general image synthesis, it demands accurate interpretation of technical content and transformation of abstract ideas into clear, standardized visuals. This task is significantly more knowledge-intensive and laborious, often requiring hours of manual work and specialized tools. Automating it in a controllable, intelligent manner would provide substantial practical value. Yet, no benchmark currently exists to evaluate AI on this front. To fill this gap, we introduce SridBench, the first benchmark for scientific figure generation. It comprises 1,120 instances curated from leading scientific papers across 13 natural and computer science disciplines, collected via human experts and MLLMs. Each sample is evaluated along six dimensions, including semantic fidelity and structural accuracy.

    "title": "Towards Safety Reasoning in LLMs: AI-agentic Deliberation for Policy-embedded CoT Data Creation",
    "summary": "Safety reasoning is a recent paradigm where LLMs reason over safety policies before generating responses, thereby mitigating limitations in existing safety measures such as over-refusal and jailbreak vulnerabilities. However, implementing this paradigm is challenging due to the resource-intensive process of creating high-quality policy-embedded chain-of-thought (CoT) datasets while ensuring reasoning remains accurate and free from hallucinations or policy conflicts. To tackle this, we propose AIDSAFE: Agentic Iterative Deliberation for Safety Reasoning, a novel data generation recipe that leverages multi-agent deliberation to iteratively expand reasoning on safety policies. A data refiner stage in AIDSAFE ensures high-quality outputs by eliminating repetitive, redundant, and deceptive thoughts. AIDSAFE-generated CoTs provide a strong foundation for supervised fine-tuning (SFT)-based safety training. Additionally, to address the need of preference data in alignment stages, such as DPO training, we introduce a supplemental recipe that uses belief augmentation to create distinct selected and rejected CoT samples. Our evaluations demonstrate that AIDSAFE-generated CoTs achieve superior policy adherence and reasoning quality. Consequently, we show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on these CoTs can significantly improve safety generalization and jailbreak robustness while maintaining acceptable utility and over-refusal accuracy.

It contains 1,473 annotated chest X-ray reports, each reviewed by experts, and 80 of them contain longitudinal annotations to capture disease progression and inter-study intervals, also reviewed by experts. Using this benchmark, we develop a two-stage framework that transforms generated reports into fine-grained, schema-aligned structured representations, enabling longitudinal interpretation. We also propose LUNGUAGESCORE, an interpretable metric that compares structured outputs at the entity, relation, and attribute level while modeling temporal consistency across patient timelines. These contributions establish the first benchmark dataset, structuring framework, and evaluation metric for sequential radiology reporting, with empirical results demonstrating that LUNGUAGESCORE effectively supports structured report evaluation.

Recently, advanced ODE-based solvers have been developed to mitigate the substantial computational demands of reverse-diffusion solving under limited sampling steps. However, these solvers, heavily inspired by Adams-like multistep methods, rely solely on t-related Lagrange interpolation. We show that t-related Lagrange interpolation is suboptimal for diffusion model and reveal a compact search space comprised of time steps and solver coefficients. Building on our analysis, we propose a novel differentiable solver search algorithm to identify more optimal solver. Equipped with the searched solver, rectified-flow models, e.g., SiT-XL/2 and FlowDCN-XL/2, achieve FID scores of 2.40 and 2.35, respectively, on ImageNet256 with only 10 steps. Meanwhile, DDPM model, DiT-XL/2, reaches a FID score of 2.33 with only 10 steps. Notably, our searched solver outperforms traditional solvers by a significant margin.

Uni-Instruct is motivated by our proposed diffusion expansion theory of the f-divergence family. Then we introduce key theories that overcome the intractability issue of the original expanded f-divergence, resulting in an equivalent yet tractable loss that effectively trains one-step diffusion models by minimizing the expanded f-divergence family. The novel unification introduced by Uni-Instruct not only offers new theoretical contributions that help understand existing approaches from a high-level perspective but also leads to state-of-the-art one-step diffusion generation performances. On the CIFAR10 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves record-breaking Frechet Inception Distance (FID) values of \\emph{1.46} for unconditional generation and \\emph{1.38} for conditional generation. On the ImageNet-64times 64 generation benchmark, Uni-Instruct achieves a new SoTA one-step generation FID of \\emph{1.02}, which outperforms its 79-step teacher diffusion with a significant improvement margin of 1.33 (1.02 vs 2.35). We also apply Uni-Instruct on broader tasks like text-to-3D generation. For text-to-3D generation, Uni-Instruct gives decent results, which slightly outperforms previous methods, such as SDS and VSD, in terms of both generation quality and diversity. Both the solid theoretical and empirical contributions of Uni-Instruct will potentially help future studies on one-step diffusion distillation and knowledge transferring of diffusion models.",

However, standard CFG often employs a static unconditional input, which can be suboptimal for iterative generation processes where model uncertainty varies dynamically. We introduce Adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance (A-CFG), a novel method that tailors the unconditional input by leveraging the model's instantaneous predictive confidence. At each step of an iterative (masked) diffusion language model, A-CFG identifies tokens in the currently generated sequence for which the model exhibits low confidence. These tokens are temporarily re-masked to create a dynamic, localized unconditional input. This focuses CFG's corrective influence precisely on areas of ambiguity, leading to more effective guidance. We integrate A-CFG into a state-of-the-art masked diffusion language model and demonstrate its efficacy. Experiments on diverse language generation benchmarks show that A-CFG yields substantial improvements over standard CFG, achieving, for instance, a 3.9 point gain on GPQA. Our work highlights the benefit of dynamically adapting guidance mechanisms to model uncertainty in iterative generation.",

To model the relationships between concepts and preferences, we propose a white-box Hierarchical Multi-Domain Regression model that captures both domain-general and domain-specific effects. To evaluate our method, we curate a dataset spanning eight challenging and diverse domains and explain twelve mechanisms. Our method achieves strong preference prediction performance, outperforming baselines while also being explainable. Additionally, we assess explanations in two application-driven settings.

    "summary": "Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation methods can effectively transfer reasoning abilities to base models but suffer from two major limitations: excessive verbosity of reasoning traces and inadequate adaptability to problem difficulty. Long reasoning traces significantly increase inference costs, and uniform-length solutions prevent base models from learning adaptive reasoning strategies. To address these issues, we propose a difficulty-aware prompting (DAP) method to dynamically shorten reasoning traces without performance loss. In our approach, a large teacher model first judges each problem's difficulty and then rewrites its reasoning traces to an appropriate shorter length, yielding concise yet complete reasoning traces. Leveraging the DAP pipeline, we curate a distilled dataset called LiteCoT consisting of 100K concise reasoning examples, with solutions averaging only 720 tokens (an order of magnitude shorter than typical CoTs). Using LiteCoT, we distilled a new family of reasoning models called Liter (1.5B, 7B, and 32B) based on the Qwen2.5 architecture. Experiments show that a student model fine-tuned on just 100K of these difficulty-pruned CoT samples outperforms a model distilled on 800K original Long CoT samples, while significantly reducing training and inference costs. Our method also generalizes well: across 11 diverse benchmarks, the shorter difficulty-aware CoTs achieve equal or better accuracy than Long chains, using far fewer tokens. For example, on the challenging AIME24 exam, our approach reaches 74.2% Pass@1 using only about 5K inference tokens, surpassing other methods that consume many more tokens.

Furthermore, we uncover the knowledge homophily, where topologically close entities exhibit similar levels of knowledgeability, which further motivates us to develop graph machine learning models to estimate entity knowledge based on its local neighbors. This model further enables valuable knowledge checking by selecting triplets less known to LLMs. Empirical results show that using selected triplets for fine-tuning leads to superior performance.",

    "title": "Evaluating Text Creativity across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Large Language Model Evaluator",
    "summary": "Creativity evaluation remains a challenging frontier for large language models (LLMs). Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity, leveraging shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human-generated and synthetic data in training highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs. We will release all data, code, and models publicly soon to support further research.",

    "title": "TokBench: Evaluating Your Visual Tokenizer before Visual Generation",
    "summary": "In this work, we reveal the limitations of visual tokenizers and VAEs in preserving fine-grained features, and propose a benchmark to evaluate reconstruction performance for two challenging visual contents: text and face. Visual tokenizers and VAEs have significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal modeling by providing more efficient compressed or quantized image representations. However, while helping production models reduce computational burdens, the information loss from image compression fundamentally limits the upper bound of visual generation quality. To evaluate this upper bound, we focus on assessing reconstructed text and facial features since they typically: 1) exist at smaller scales, 2) contain dense and rich textures, 3) are prone to collapse, and 4) are highly sensitive to human vision. We first collect and curate a diverse set of clear text and face images from existing datasets. Unlike approaches using VLM models, we employ established OCR and face recognition models for evaluation, ensuring accuracy while maintaining an exceptionally lightweight assessment process <span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(214, 21, 21);\">requiring just 2GB memory and 4 minutes</span> to complete. Using our benchmark, we analyze text and face reconstruction quality across various scales for different image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results show modern visual tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, especially at smaller scales. We further extend this evaluation framework to video, conducting comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we demonstrate that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect reconstruction performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an effective complement.",

    "title": "CXReasonBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Structured Diagnostic Reasoning in Chest X-rays",
    "summary": "Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench, a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements, computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance, enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases, each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation.

    "title": "PatientSim: A Persona-Driven Simulator for Realistic Doctor-Patient Interactions",
    "summary": "Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios, grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles, including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes: personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.",

    "title": "Breaking Down Video LLM Benchmarks: Knowledge, Spatial Perception, or True Temporal Understanding?",
    "summary": "Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains: LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess video LLMs.",
